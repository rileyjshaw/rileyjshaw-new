2015: first bingo! [eli](https://twitter.com/veryeli) and i used the attendee
directory to generate a unique card for everyone (twitter login kept it private
🔒). squares on your card were other attendees - if you met someone on your
card you got to check it off. we made it cuz we’re shy. most of it is in the
`pre-2019` folder!

2016: we made the cards prettier by pulling in people’s twitter photos and
doing imgmagick to them 🔮

2017: no xoxo, no bingo… missed u all

2018: xoxo was in the midst of changing their infrastructure, so i lost access
to the attendee directory. [hannah](https://twitter.com/herlifeinpixels),
[jason](https://twitter.com/justsomeguy) and i met in a cafe before the kickoff
ceremony and designed a static version with input from the community. hannah
and jason made 25 icons in like two minutes, it was incredible!!!

2019: i've been too cheap to get https://xoxo.bingo in previous years, but
[andy](https://twitter.com/andymcmillan) noticed a thread on slack and hooked
us up! thx andy.

This had a few advantages:</p><ol>
<li>Text content could be easy processed and manipulated (admittedly, I wasn't using this for anything).</li>
<li>Toggling styles was as easy as adding and removing a  element from &lt;body&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory, this strategy would beat out almost every other style rule (some inline styles excepted). &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#cascading-order"&gt;User &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; rules used to override author &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; rules&lt;/a&gt;, but Chrome &lt;a href="https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?revision=234007&amp;amp;view=revision"&gt;no-longer does user stylesheets&lt;/a&gt;. I figured an aggressively &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; author stylesheet added at the very bottom of the page was pretty solid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some testing, I realized that &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; styles from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt; injection (along with chrome.tabs.insertCSS) actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; take precedence over author stylesheets. Since 3) was the key consideration for my original decision, I re-wrote the extension to inject a stylesheet from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change in architecture had pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ Improved chance of dark theme winning out over author styles.
+ Allowed styles to be applied before any other DOM is constructed, substantially reducing time-to-darkness.
+ Simplified the callbacks between background.js and client.js, reduced code, and made the entire extension easier to reason about.

- With 1) above, I could&amp;#39;ve handled variant rules (eg. specificityHelper) with a few regular expressions. Locking into a static stylesheet added some huge copypastas, tripling the size of main.css.
- Injected stylesheets aren&amp;#39;t accessible once they&amp;#39;ve been added. Rather than &amp;quot;turning the styles off&amp;quot; like in 2), the best option was to add a toggle class to &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;.
- Rewrites take time.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commit was essentially a full rewrite, so I changed some smaller things while I was at it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Styles now look for :not(.off) instead of .on. This makes the default dark and avoids a Blinding White Flash before the class changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added id specificity helpers; it&amp;#39;s discussed further in client.js:24.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renamed some files for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across some unfortunate Chromium bugs while working on this, which caused me to dive into that project. It&amp;#39;s huge! Lots of fun to poke around :)&lt;/p&gt;</li>

<p>Three farmers were selling chickens at the local market. One farmer had 10 chickens to sell, another had 16 chickens to sell, and the last had 26 chickens to sell. In order not to compete with each other, they agreed to all sell their chickens at the same price. But by lunchtime, they decided that sales were not going so well, and they all decided to lower their prices to the same lower price point. By the end of the day, they had sold all their chickens. It turned out that they all collected the same amount of money, $35, from the day's chicken sales. What was the price of the chickens before lunchtime and after lunchtime?</p>

<p>Sooner or later you will hit the <code class="language-text">RESET</code> key when you did not intend to. It is inevitable, unless your Apple II requires you to type <code class="language-text">CTRL-RESET</code> instead of just plain <code class="language-text">RESET</code>. You can reduce the hazard by carefully prying off the plastic keytop, leaving just the keyswitch shaft available (Figure 2-9).</p>
<p>You can take this one step further and make it physically harder to push down the <code class="language-text">RESET</code> key. Get a small rubber washer about 3/8 inches inner diameter, 1/2 inch outer diameter, and 1/8 inch thick. Remove the <code class="language-text">RESET</code> keytop as shown in Figure 2-9. Work the washer over the exposed square flange of the keyshaft as shown in Figure 2-10. Replace the keytop.</p>

Maybe you've learned Prolog and you think the entire world should just be a database that you walk around in looking for clues.
