I remember finding a way to apply a black background to Microsoft Word 2003, then being horrified when I accidentally printed the document. In uni I scripted my desktop to boot into <a href="https://justgetflux.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">f.lux</a>‚Äôs darkroom mode. One of my only lasting contributions to <a href="/blog/the-pool-on-the-roof-must-have-a-leak">Signal</a> was loudly advocating for dark mode on iOS and Desktop, not just Android. I even <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-theme-everywhere/nibjplbnmmklkfnkpecgbffkifmdbjed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made a browser extension in 2015</a> to apply a dark theme to the entire Internet.</p><p>It‚Äôs not the most pressing or exciting work, but I decided my site should have a dark theme of its own. I took a lot of inspiration from my former Khan Academy teammate <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Josh W. Comeau‚Äôs dark mode post</a>, with a few differences.</p>]]></description><link>https://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io/1c9ceef36f4fef69fd3a20b65414de774f3bf3e1</link><guid isPermaLink="false">COMMIT_1C9CEEF36F4FEF69FD3A20B65414DE774F3BF3E1</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The responsive edit]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Another big one:</p><ul>

Though there are <em>still</em> design problems and omissions, the site is much further along than it was on initial release. Some highlights:</p><ul>
<li><a href="/lab">/lab</a> no-longer crashes Webkit based browsers (lol)</li>
<li>I added <em>bunch</em> of new scrapers. Most recently: SoundCloud, Vimeo, and YouTube.</li>
<li>The design is still uh‚Ä¶ getting there‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs at least simpler and more consistent now.</li>
<li>I test-drove the blog and added some new features (like MDX!)</li>

card you got to check it off. we made it cuz we‚Äôre shy. most of it is in the
`pre-2019` folder!

2016: we made the cards prettier by pulling in people‚Äôs twitter photos and
doing imgmagick to them üîÆ

2017: no xoxo, no bingo‚Ä¶ missed u all

2018: xoxo was in the midst of changing their infrastructure, so i lost access
to the attendee directory. [hannah](https://twitter.com/herlifeinpixels),
[jason](https://twitter.com/justsomeguy) and i met in a cafe before the kickoff
ceremony and designed a static version with input from the community. hannah
and jason made 25 icons in like two minutes, it was incredible!!!

2019: i've been too cheap to get https://xoxo.bingo in previous years, but

Even different servos of the same model might vary a bit. Currently, the Arduino Servo library has a severely restricted hard limit on the pulse widths that can be sent to servos. Specifically:</p><ul>
<li>Minimum pulse width must be between [32, 1052].</li>
<li>Maximum pulse width must be between [1888, 2908].</li>
</ul><p>Many popular servos have min/max pulse widths that fall in that unavailable range between (1052, 1888). For instance, the <a href="https://parallax.com/sites/default/files/downloads/900-00360-Feedback-360-HS-Servo-v1.2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Parallax Feedback 360¬∞ High-Speed Servo</a> operates between [1280, 1720].</p><p>Before this commit, each instance of <code>Servo</code> stored their <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> values as <code>int8_t</code>. Since that only leaves room for values in the range [-128, 127], it can't store meaningful servo pulse widths, which are typically in the ~[1000, 2000]¬µs range. To compensate, <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> store the distance from the default values, divided by 4‚Ä¶</p>]]></description><link>https://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/Servo/36f25f4f3a18bbb048b9be3b8dc24d65f10ec273</link><guid isPermaLink="false">COMMIT_36F25F4F3A18BBB048B9BE3B8DC24D65F10EC273</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fix #3: Update min and max to sensible defaults]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>R/C servos have a standard pulse width range of 1000 to 2000¬µs<sup name="user-content-a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>, with the zero point between the two at 1500¬µs.
