I eventually decided that separating my collection process would be good for flexibility, control, and offline work.</p>\\n<h3>Flexibility</h3>\\n<p>GraphQL\'s filters and transforms are powerful, and Gatsby\'s APIs add more options for how data is fetched, cached, and transformed. However, complicated or non-standard data transforms and sanitization are much easier outside of Gatsby\'s ecosystem. For instance, the API starts to feel clunky for one-off treatment of specific content nodes,</p>\\n<h3>Control</h3>\\n<p>I\'ve had a good experience with Gatsby but I may decide to migrate my site to another platform or format someday. Keeping my data entirely separate from the from the site\'s framework makes migrating my data as easy as copy/pasting this directory. It\'s just a few JS files!</p>\\n<h3>Offline</h3>\\n<p>Gatsby stores requests made through its source plugins in the <code>.cache</code> directory by default. The <code>.cache</code> directory is deleted after:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>gatsby clean</code> is called.</li>\\n<li><code>package.json</code> changes, for example a dependency is updated or added.</li>\\n<li><code>gatsby-config.js</code> changes, for example a plugin is added or modified.</li>\\n<li><code>gatsby-node.js</code> changes, for example if a new Node API is invoked.</li>\\n<li>…etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I found I was frequently triggering <code>.cache</code> wipes during development. At best this meant I was pinging APIs and atom feeds more than necessary. At worst, it made working offline with project data impossible.</p>\\n<h2>Directory structure</h2>\\n<p>Here\'s how the scraper is organized for now:</p>\\n<pre><code>scrape-projects.js\\n\\tThe megafile to replace Gatsby\'s source plugins.

Read more about my reasoning below, or skip to the <a href=\\"#structure\\">directory structure</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Why?</h2>\\n<p>Gatsby\'s source and transformer plugins are powerful, and I used them in the initial development of this site. I eventually decided that separating my collection process would be good for flexibility, control, and offline work.</p>\\n<h3>Flexibility</h3>\\n<p>GraphQL\'s filters and transforms are powerful, and Gatsby\'s APIs add more options for how data is fetched, cached, and transformed. However, complicated or non-standard data transforms and sanitization are much easier outside of Gatsby\'s ecosystem. For instance, the API starts to feel clunky for one-off treatment of specific content nodes,</p>\\n<h3>Control</h3>\\n<p>I\'ve had a good experience with Gatsby but I may decide to migrate my site to another platform or format someday. Keeping my data entirely separate from the from the site\'s framework makes migrating my data as easy as copy/pasting this directory. It\'s just a few JS files!</p>\\n<h3>Offline</h3>\\n<p>Gatsby stores requests made through its source plugins in the <code>.cache</code> directory by default. The <code>.cache</code> directory is deleted after:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>gatsby clean</code> is called.</li>\\n<li><code>package.json</code> changes, for example a dependency is updated or added.</li>\\n<li><code>gatsby-config.js</code> changes, for example a plugin is added or modified.</li>\\n<li><code>gatsby-node.js</code> changes, for example if a new Node API is invoked.</li>\\n<li>…etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I found I was frequently triggering <code>.cache</code> wipes during development. At best this meant I was pinging APIs and atom feeds more than necessary. At worst, it made working offline with project data impossible.</p>\\n<h2>Directory structure</h2>\\n<p>Here\'s how the scraper is organized for now:</p>\\n<pre><code>scrape-projects.js\\n\\tThe megafile to replace Gatsby\'s source plugins. This pulls project data\\n\\tfrom all online sources and saves them into `_generated/`.\\n\\n_generated/\\n\\tFiles generated by the `scrape-projects.js` above. DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES\\n\\tMANUALLY! They will be overwritten.\\n\\n\\tscraped-projects-raw.json\\n\\t\\tNot quite the raw response, but pretty close. This file\\n\\t\\tcontains all the data that I may decide to use someday, but\\n\\t\\thaven\'t yet. Organized by `type` in a nested object.\\n\\n    scraped-projects-formatted.json\\n\\t\\tStandardized into a smaller format that can be smashed together with\\n\\t\\t`curation/` data. Flattened into an array with `type` annotations on\\n\\t\\teach node, as well as unique, unchanging project IDs (`UID`).\\n\\ncuration/\\n\\tThis is where all custom curation and processing go, eg. tagging content.\\n\\tProjects are modified based on their generated UID.\\n\\n\\ttweaks.js\\n\\t\\tMainly for one-off changes eg. fixing formatting errors from immutable\\n\\t\\tonline sources. This file can also be used to apply changes on groups\\n\\t\\tof files.\\n\\n\\ttags.js\\n\\t\\tTODO: figure out where `tags`, `lastTagged`, and `coolness` data are\\n\\t\\tgoing to live.\\n\\nsources/\\n\\tOffline data files and collections to compliment the online data cached in\\n\\t`_generated/`.\\n\\n\\tstandalone-projects.json\\n\\t\\tTODO: Move these over from the `src/data` directory.\\n\\ntools/\\n\\tCustom tools to help classify, organize, or edit project nodes without\\n\\topening a text editor.
