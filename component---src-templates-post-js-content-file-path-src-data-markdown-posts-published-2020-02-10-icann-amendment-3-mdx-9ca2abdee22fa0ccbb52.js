I have spent most of my career working for nonprofits and small businesses.\n\nI am troubled by the pricing amendments in your new agreement with Verisign. The annual cost for .COM domain registrants is currently within reach for individuals, which is essential for the health and democracy of the Internet. With Amendment 3, Verisign will be able to price out individuals. This will have a direct and immediate negative impact on Internet users.\n\nEarlier this month, I was forced to let a project expire due to an unexpected price increase. I was running the project for a small community completely out of my own pocket. I poured dozens of hours into the project and community. The domain, prompts.club, increased in cost between 2019 and 2020 from ~$10 / year to ~$450 / year. I was forced to let the project die.\n\nI realize that .club is under different ownership, but I hope you can see the relevance.\n\nThe changes in pricing model proposed in Amendment 3 will negatively affect artists, independent developers, small businesses, and people using the Internet for anything other than profit generation. It will stifle creativity and access across the Internet.\n\nI imagine you’re getting a flood of similar letters right now. Please consider the input of Internet users in this huge decision.\n\nRegards,\nRiley Shaw\n",i.createElement("a",{href:"/"},"rileyjshaw.com")))}var c=function(e){void 0===e&&(e={});var t=Object.assign({},(0,r.ah)(),e.components).wrapper;return t?i.createElement(t,e,i.createElement(l,e)):l(e)},s=n(9357),m=n(1883),d=["data"];function h(e){var t=e.data,n=(0,a.Z)(e,d);return i.createElement(s.Z,Object.assign({},n,{title:t.mdx.fields.title}))}function u(e){var t=e.data,n=e.children,a=t.mdx.fields;return i.createElement(i.Fragment,null,i.createElement("header",{className:"top-nav",role:"banner"},i.createElement("nav",{role:"navigation"},i.createElement("h1",null,i.createElement(m.Link,{to:"/"},"Riley Shaw"))," ","/ ",i.createElement(m.Link,{to:"/blog"},"Blog")," / ",a.title)),i.createElement("main",null,i.createElement("article",{className:"blog-post-content",role:"article"},i.createElement("header",null,i.createElement("h1",null,a.title),i.createElement("div",{className:"subheading"},i.createElement("time",null,"Posted ",a.date))),i.createElement("div",{className:"blog-post-markdown"},n))))}function p(e){return i.createElement(u,e,i.createElement(c,e))}},3744:function(e,t,n){n.d(t,{B:function(){return i}});var a=n(7294),r={edit:{title:"Edit"},note:{title:"Note"},update:{title:"Update"}};t.Z=function(e){var t=e.children,n=e.date,i=e.type,o=void 0===i?"update":i;return a.createElement("div",{className:"blog-banner blog-banner-"+o},a.createElement("div",{className:"blog-banner-title"},r[o].title+(n?"
