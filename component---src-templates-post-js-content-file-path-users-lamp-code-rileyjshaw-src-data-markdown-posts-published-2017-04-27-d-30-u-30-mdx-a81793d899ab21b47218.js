I was assured that it was on your radar.\n\nI’m extremely disappointed that a woman doesn’t show up until #14.\n\nThe following lines were cut from my bio:\n\n&gt; Technology isn’t an equalizing force; it’s whatever we make it.\n\n&gt; He’s interested in improving resources for folks who haven’t had the chance to be considered for lists like this one, yet.\n\nLists like the Developer 30 Under 30 have the chance to inspire a new generation of programmers. They can chip away at the subtle biases held by hiring managers, or teach parents that their daughters can program. In its current form, this list propagates the idea that good programmers are men.\n\nOn a related note, ​I intentionally mentioned Recurse Center in my bio because it is free. I question your motives for adding Queen’s University.\n\nThank you for the work that you have put into this list so far.
