One farmer had 10 chickens to sell, another had 16 chickens to sell, and the last had 26 chickens to sell. In order not to compete with each other, they agreed to all sell their chickens at the same price. But by lunchtime, they decided that sales were not going so well, and they all decided to lower their prices to the same lower price point. By the end of the day, they had sold all their chickens. It turned out that they all collected the same amount of money, $35, from the day’s chicken sales. What was the price of the chickens before lunchtime and after lunchtime?\n\nI’d been nerd sniped, and…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"tags":["math","riddle"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_CHICKEN_PRICES","slug":"/blog/chicken-prices","title":"Riddle: chicken prices","date":"2014-10-28"}},{"description":"I started writing this in April.

They allow us to make transistors1, which allow us to make integrated circuits, which allow us to build calculators and flight control systems and iPads. The transistor is the unequivocal poster child of semiconductor physics. It was developed in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs.\n\nIt may have far-reaching significance in electronics and electrical communication.\n\nThis post is not about the transistor. It’s about the beginning of an industry that has changed the way we communicate. It’s also sort of about capitalism.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1874, German physicist Ferdinand Braun created a diode…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"tags":["electrical","hardware","history","physics"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_THE_CATS_WHISKER_DETECTOR","slug":"/blog/the-cats-whisker-detector","title":"The cat’s-whisker detector","date":"2014-04-22"}}]},"allCombinedProjectsJson":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"internalLimit":3,"internalSkip":12,"externalLimit":0,"externalSkip":15,"numPages":13,"currentPage":10}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
