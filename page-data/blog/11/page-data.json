It is inevitable, unless your Apple II requires you to type CTRL-RESET instead of just plain RESET. You can reduce the hazard by carefully prying off the plastic keytop, leaving just the keyswitch shaft available (Figure 2-9).\n\nYou can take this one step further and make it physically harder to push down the RESET key. Get a small rubber washer about 3/8 inches inner diameter, 1/2 inch outer diameter, and 1/8 inch thick. Remove the RESET keytop as shown in Figure 2-9.

Maybe you’ve learned Prolog and you think the entire world should just be a database that you walk around in looking for clues. Even worse, I’m betting you’ve been using an IDE, so your brain is riddled with memory holes and you can’t even type out an entire function’s name without hitting CTRL-SPACE every 3 characters you type.\n\nBr…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"tags":["c","db","quote"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_A_LANGUAGE_FOR_WEAKLINGS","slug":"/blog/a-language-for-weaklings","title":"A language for weaklings","date":"2014-04-01"}},{"description":"I was recently browsing a beautiful red monochrome1 site. There were a few call-to-action buttons on the page that transitioned to green on hover. Where did that brown come from?! The initial red looks great, the final green looks great, but everything between is pretty dismal. Why is that?\n\nThe RGB color model\n\nRed Green and Blue are the three primary additive colors.
