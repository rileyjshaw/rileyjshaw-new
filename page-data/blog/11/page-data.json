It began, Three months ago I was in Toronto, squeezing in one last show at The Rex before shipping off to New York.\n\nI had just finished Hacker School and wanted to write a retrospective post. I also wanted to officially resign from the Iron Blogger crew. But I was on a kiteboarding trip at the time, and the wind was picking up.\n\nMy three preceding posts are shoddy. Two are short quotes from materials I’d been reading through. The other reads like an assignment. All three were started on Monday morning before check-ins because I didn’t want to lose a bet.\n\nI’m glad that I have a blog now. It’s a great way to share cool things that I’ve learned and silly things…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["life","meta","hackerschool"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_FIN","slug":"/blog/fin","title":"Fin?","date":"2014-10-12"}},{"description":"Semiconductors are important. They allow us to make transistors1, which allow us to make integrated circuits, which allow us to build calculators and flight control systems and iPads. The transistor is the unequivocal poster child of semiconductor physics. It was developed in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs.\n\nIt may have far-reaching significance in electronics and electrical communication.\n\nThis post is not about the transistor. It’s about the beginning of an industry that has changed the way we communicate. It’s also sort of about capitalism.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1874, German physicist Ferdinand Braun created a diode…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["electrical","hardware","history","physics"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_THE_CATS_WHISKER_DETECTOR","slug":"/blog/the-cats-whisker-detector","title":"The cat’s-whisker detector","date":"2014-04-22"}},{"description":"From page 33 of the Apple II User’s Guide: Sooner or later you will hit the RESET key when you did not intend to. It is inevitable, unless your Apple II requires you to type CTRL-RESET instead of just plain RESET. You can reduce the hazard by carefully prying off the plastic keytop, leaving just the keyswitch shaft available (Figure 2-9).\n\nYou can take this one step further and make it physically harder to push down the RESET key. Get a small rubber washer about 3/8 inches inner diameter, 1/2 inch outer diameter, and 1/8 inch thick. Remove the RESET keytop as shown in Figure 2-9. Work the washer over the exposed square flange of the keyshaft as shown in Figure 2-10.
