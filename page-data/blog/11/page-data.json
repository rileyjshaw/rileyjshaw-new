The results of the US presidential election last Tuesday shocked me. I checked Twitter to find that my entire feed felt the same. Again. Oops, I created a comfortable echo-chamber for myself. Social news algorithms have been under intense scrutiny over the past week. I wanted to see what other people’s social media bubbles looked like, so I wrote a little shell script . I’m not interested in building empathy for racists. I  am  interested in improving my own awareness. This tool displaces me from the narrative I chose and delivers me from opinions I agree with.

This had a few advantages:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Text content could be easy processed and manipulated (admittedly, I wasn't using this for anything).</li>\n<li>Toggling styles was as easy as adding and removing a  element from &lt;body&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In theory, this strategy would beat out almost every other style rule (some inline styles excepted). &lt;a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#cascading-order\"&gt;User &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; rules used to override author &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; rules&lt;/a&gt;, but Chrome &lt;a href=\"https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?revision=234007&amp;amp;view=revision\"&gt;no-longer does user stylesheets&lt;/a&gt;. I figured an aggressively &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; author stylesheet added at the very bottom of the page was pretty solid.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After some testing, I realized that &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; styles from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt; injection (along with chrome.tabs.insertCSS) actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; take precedence over author stylesheets. Since 3) was the key consideration for my original decision, I re-wrote the extension to inject a stylesheet from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This change in architecture had pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ Improved chance of dark theme winning out over author styles.\n+ Allowed styles to be applied before any other DOM is constructed, substantially reducing time-to-darkness.\n+ Simplified the callbacks between background.js and client.js, reduced code, and made the entire extension easier to reason about.\n\n- With 1) above, I could&amp;#39;ve handled variant rules (eg. specificityHelper) with a few regular expressions. Locking into a static stylesheet added some huge copypastas, tripling the size of main.css.\n- Injected stylesheets aren&amp;#39;t accessible once they&amp;#39;ve been added. Rather than &amp;quot;turning the styles off&amp;quot; like in 2), the best option was to add a toggle class to &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;.\n- Rewrites take time.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This commit was essentially a full rewrite, so I changed some smaller things while I was at it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Styles now look for :not(.off) instead of .on. This makes the default dark and avoids a Blinding White Flash before the class changes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added id specificity helpers; it&amp;#39;s discussed further in client.js:24.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Renamed some files for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came across some unfortunate Chromium bugs while working on this, which caused me to dive into that project. It&amp;#39;s huge! Lots of fun to poke around :)&lt;/p&gt;</li>\n</ol>","more":false}]}},"pageContext":{"internalLimit":2,"internalSkip":7,"externalLimit":3,"externalSkip":43,"numPages":15,"currentPage":11}},"staticQueryHashes":["3605882644"]}
