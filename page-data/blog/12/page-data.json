I recently joined the developer team at Khan Academy. Since arriving I’ve been surprised by a number of intentional decisions the organization has made to empower its developers. Whether you’re working in tech or just curious about the inner workings of Khan Academy, there’s some great wisdom in how things are done here. All aboard! A benefit of working at an education startup is that everyone naturally puts a lot of thought into information design. As a result, this has been the smoothest onboarding I’ve experienced. Onboarding actually started a few weeks before my first work day. As soon as my offer came through  Andy  sent…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["education","life","web"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_KHAN_ACADEMY_PRIMER","slug":"/blog/khan-academy-primer","title":"Khan Academy: a new employee’s primer","date":"2015-07-20"}}},{"node":{"description":"An entirely skippable preface (Seriously, we don’t start building it until the  third section .) While going through some of my dustier folders on a  flight to Hawaii  I came across  The Nature of Code . It’s a lovely book with plenty of inspiration for simple demos; perfect plane material. After working through a few chapters, I moved my particle system and canvas logic into their own  util.js  file. Until then i’d been creating a new HTML file for each demo, manually adding the title, script includes, and next/previous links. This meant that I had to edit each file to include  util.js . It was a frustrating amount of overhead considering each demo only took a few minutes to write. didn’t…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["howto","web"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_HOW_TO_GENERATE_A_STATIC_SITE_FROM_A_FOLDER_OF_ASSETS_USING_GULP","slug":"/blog/how-to-generate-a-static-site-from-a-folder-of-assets-using-Gulp","title":"How to generate a static site from a folder of assets using Gulp","date":"2015-03-05"}}},{"node":{"description":"This post was originally published on the  Signal blog . Today we hiked the Kalalau Trail and swam beneath the cold spray of a waterfall. Today we discussed the finer points of the axolotl protocol used by TextSecure. Today we delighted in “shave ice”, a local delicacy that is definitely  not  a snow cone. Today we wrote copy, polished features, closed bugs, and merged pull-requests. Measured by lines of code, today was short. Measured by steps taken, it was tall. Measured by ideas discussed, things learned, and sights seen, it was towering. For the past week and a half I’ve been trapped on an island among a team of brilliant hackers. A curious duality exists on the island.

Even if you don’t understand  why  it works, having a set of steps that will always get you to the same destination feels nice. In life there are few patterns that consistently produce the same outcome. But in math? Hoo boy… This post takes us through two  very  simple procedures that converge to a numerical endpoint. We’re going to graph the amount of time it takes to reach this endpoint, which actually ends up being quite pretty. Careful; such routines can be somewhat of a rabbit hole. As  xkcd ’s Randall Munroe puts it, The Collatz Conjecture states that if you pick a number, and if it’s even divide it by two and if it’s odd…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["math","hobby","build"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_GRAPHING_DEPTH","slug":"/blog/graphing-depth","title":"Graphing depth","date":"2014-12-04"}}}]},"allCombinedProjectsJson":{"nodes":[{"uid":"COMMIT_0167A91073922AC7B5018C6A73C894853DABBA56","title":"Remove numkey layout bindings","date":"2015-12-23","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/.supermac/0167a91073922ac7b5018c6a73c894853dabba56","repo":"rileyjshaw/.supermac","description":"<p>1, 2, 3, and 4 are useful for app-specific bindings and should thus be reserved.</p>","more":false}]}},"pageContext":{"internalLimit":4,"internalSkip":9,"externalLimit":1,"externalSkip":46,"numPages":15,"currentPage":12}},"staticQueryHashes":["3605882644"]}
