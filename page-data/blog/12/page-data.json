One of those “usable” languages that lets you get away with sloppy thinking and half-assed hackery like Python or Ruby. Or, maybe you use a language like Lisp that pretends the computer is some purely functional fantasy land with padded walls for little babies. Maybe you’ve learned Prolog and you think the entire world should just be a database that you walk around in looking for clues. Even worse, I’m betting you’ve been using an IDE, so your brain is riddled with memory holes and you can’t even type out an entire function’s name without hitting CTRL-SPACE every 3 characters you type.\n\nBr…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"tags":["c","db","quote"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_A_LANGUAGE_FOR_WEAKLINGS","slug":"/blog/a-language-for-weaklings","title":"A language for weaklings","date":"2014-04-01"}},{"description":"I was recently browsing a beautiful red monochrome1 site.

Your browser takes an 8-bit intensity value for each of the R, G, and B components to determine the output color. This is often represented as three two-digit hex values (for…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"tags":["color","css","javascript","web"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_HUE_ANGLE_TRANSITIONS","slug":"/blog/hue-angle-transitions","title":"Hue-angle transitions","date":"2014-03-31"}},{"description":"Guess what? Chemistry isn’t the only high school course built on a foundation of lies. In art class we’re taught that the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. Not only is it wrong to say that there are three true primary colors, but if we were to pick three, we’d pick a better combination. Let there be light\n\nA band of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum between 390nm and 700nm makes up the visible spectrum of light; we perceive different wavelengths within this spectrum as colors. White light is a combination of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum.\n\nHumans are trichromats, which means that we have three types of color receptors (cone cells).
