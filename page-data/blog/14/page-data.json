Chemistry isn’t the only high school course built on a  foundation of lies.  In art class we’re taught that the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. Not only is it wrong to say that there are three true primary colors, but if we  were  to pick three, we’d pick a better combination. Let there be light A band of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum between 390nm and 700nm makes up the  visible spectrum of light ; we perceive different wavelengths within this spectrum as colors.  White light  is a combination of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Humans are  trichromats , which means that we have three types of color receptors ( cone cells ).

I had a hunch that it would end up sounding like garbage, and I was totally right. If you took the average color of a beautiful painting, it would likely turn out poo brown. Today, I created the audio equivalent: Blazo’s Misty Sapphire : Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians : Kill the Noise remix of KOAN Sound’s Talk Box : These first tones were generated using the powerful, free, cross-platform audio software  Audacity  and a cool lisp-y language called  Nyquist .

The rules are simple: Get a blog Write on said blog at least once a week Failing completion of #2, be humiliated and ostracized. Also, forfeit \\$5. I don’t think that we’ve decided on where the money is going yet; I’m hoping for giant Iron Blogger belt buckles. Of course I’ll do that! At the start of the batch I vowed to avoid any projects focusing on front-end design work, including a personal site. Oops. I also vowed to try my hand at blogging; breaking one vow to fulfill the other can’t be that bad, right? I made an addendum, stating that I could spend exactly  two  days making a site… and here we are!
