Even if you don’t understand why it works, having a set of steps that will always get you to the same destination feels nice. In life there are few patterns that consistently produce the same outcome. But in math? Hoo boy… This post takes us through two very simple procedures that converge to a numerical endpoint. We’re going to graph the amount of time it takes to reach this endpoint, which actually ends up being quite pretty.\n\nCareful; such routines can be somewhat of a rabbit hole. As xkcd’s Randall Munroe puts it,\n\nThe Collatz Conjecture states that if you pick a number, and if it’s even divide it by two and if it’s odd…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["math","hobby","build"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_GRAPHING_DEPTH","slug":"/blog/graphing-depth","title":"Graphing depth","date":"2014-12-04"}},{"description":"History-sniffing attacks let front-end code peek at other sites you’ve visited. They can be used to target ads, steal information, or discern your identity. Creepy. Historically, one of the most popular history-sniffing techniques was to style  links using CSS and check their color with JavaScript. Major browsers started implementing privacy changes to address this attack in 2010.1 As a result, JavaScript’s  now returns unvisited styles for visited sites.\n\nEven with these limitations there are a number of ways to scrape a user’s…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["security","css","build"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_STEALING_HISTORY_WITH_CSS_BINARY_TREES","slug":"/blog/stealing-history-with-CSS-binary-trees","title":"Stealing history with CSS binary trees","date":"2014-11-12"}},{"description":"Someone posted a riddle a few days ago: Three farmers were selling chickens at the local market. One farmer had 10 chickens to sell, another had 16 chickens to sell, and the last had 26 chickens to sell. In order not to compete with each other, they agreed to all sell their chickens at the same price. But by lunchtime, they decided that sales were not going so well, and they all decided to lower their prices to the same lower price point. By the end of the day, they had sold all their chickens. It turned out that they all collected the same amount of money, $35, from the day’s chicken sales. What was the price of the chickens before lunchtime and after lunchtime?\n\nI’d been nerd sniped, and…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["math","riddle"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_CHICKEN_PRICES","slug":"/blog/chicken-prices","title":"Riddle: chicken prices","date":"2014-10-28"}},{"description":"I started writing this in April. It began, Three months ago I was in Toronto, squeezing in one last show at The Rex before shipping off to New York.\n\nI had just finished Hacker School and wanted to write a retrospective post. I also wanted to officially resign from the Iron Blogger crew. But I was on a kiteboarding trip at the time, and the wind was picking up.\n\nMy three preceding posts are shoddy. Two are short quotes from materials I’d been reading through. The other reads like an assignment.
