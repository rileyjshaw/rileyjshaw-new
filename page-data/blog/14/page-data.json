Today we hiked the Kalalau Trail and swam beneath the cold spray of a waterfall. Today we discussed the finer points of the axolotl protocol used by TextSecure. Today we delighted in “shave ice”, a local delicacy that is definitely  not  a snow cone. Today we wrote copy, polished features, closed bugs, and merged pull-requests. Measured by lines of code, today was short. Measured by steps taken, it was tall. Measured by ideas discussed, things learned, and sights seen, it was towering. For the past week and a half I’ve been trapped on an island among a team of brilliant hackers. A curious duality exists on the island.

Even if you don’t understand  why  it works, having a set of steps that will always get you to the same destination feels nice. In life there are few patterns that consistently produce the same outcome. But in math? Hoo boy… This post takes us through two  very  simple procedures that converge to a numerical endpoint. We’re going to graph the amount of time it takes to reach this endpoint, which actually ends up being quite pretty. Careful; such routines can be somewhat of a rabbit hole. As  xkcd ’s Randall Munroe puts it, The Collatz Conjecture states that if you pick a number, and if it’s even divide it by two and if it’s odd…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["math","hobby","build"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_GRAPHING_DEPTH","slug":"/blog/graphing-depth","title":"Graphing depth","date":"2014-12-04"}}},{"node":{"description":"History-sniffing attacks let front-end code peek at other sites you’ve visited. They can be used to target ads, steal information, or discern your identity. Creepy. Historically, one of the most popular history-sniffing techniques was to style  :visited  links using CSS and check their color with JavaScript. Major browsers started implementing  privacy changes  to address this attack in 2010.  As a result, JavaScript’s  getComputedStyle  now returns unvisited styles for visited sites. Even with these limitations there are a number of ways to scrape a user’s history. The remainder of this article describes a combination of tricks used to do so. The outcome is a proof-of-concept  history…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["security","css","build"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_STEALING_HISTORY_WITH_CSS_BINARY_TREES","slug":"/blog/stealing-history-with-CSS-binary-trees","title":"Stealing history with CSS binary trees","date":"2014-11-12"}}},{"node":{"description":"Someone posted a riddle a few days ago: Three farmers were selling chickens at the local market. One farmer had 10 chickens to sell, another had 16 chickens to sell, and the last had 26 chickens to sell. In order not to compete with each other, they agreed to all sell their chickens at the same price. But by lunchtime, they decided that sales were not going so well, and they all decided to lower their prices to the same lower price point. By the end of the day, they had sold all their chickens. It turned out that they all collected the same amount of money, $35, from the day’s chicken sales. What was the price of the chickens before lunchtime and after lunchtime? I’d been  nerd sniped , and…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["math","riddle"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_CHICKEN_PRICES","slug":"/blog/chicken-prices","title":"Riddle: chicken prices","date":"2014-10-28"}}},{"node":{"description":"I started writing this in April. It began, Three months ago I was in Toronto, squeezing in one last show at The Rex before shipping off to New York. I had just finished  Hacker School  and wanted to write a retrospective post. I also wanted to officially resign from the  Iron Blogger  crew. But I was on a kiteboarding trip at the time, and the wind was picking up. My three preceding posts are shoddy. Two are  short   quotes  from materials I’d been reading through. The  other  reads like an assignment. All three were started on Monday morning before check-ins because I didn’t want to lose a bet. I’m glad that I have a blog now. It’s a great way to share  cool things that I’ve learned  and…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["life","meta","hackerschool"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_FIN","slug":"/blog/fin","title":"Fin?","date":"2014-10-12"}}}]},"allCombinedProjectsJson":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"internalLimit":5,"internalSkip":11,"externalLimit":0,"externalSkip":54,"numPages":16,"currentPage":14}},
