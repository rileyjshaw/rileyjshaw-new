One of those “usable” languages that lets you get away with sloppy thinking and half-assed hackery like Python or Ruby. Or, maybe you use a language like Lisp that pretends the computer is some purely functional fantasy land with padded walls for little babies. Maybe you’ve learned Prolog and you think the entire world should just be a database that you walk around in looking for clues. Even worse, I’m betting you’ve been using an IDE, so your brain is riddled with memory holes and you can’t even type out an entire function’s name without hitting CTRL-SPACE every 3 characters you type.

I was recently browsing a beautiful red monochrome  site. There were a few call-to-action buttons on the page that transitioned to green on hover. Where did that brown come from?! The initial red looks great, the final green looks great, but everything between is pretty dismal. Why is that? The RGB color model R ed  G reen and  B lue are the  three primary additive colors . Your browser takes an 8-bit intensity value for each of the R, G, and B components to determine the output color. This is often represented as three two-digit hex values (for example,  #ff8800  is orange). For the subtle changes that make up 90% of color…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["color","css","javascript","web"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_HUE_ANGLE_TRANSITIONS","slug":"/blog/hue-angle-transitions","title":"Hue-angle transitions","date":"2014-03-31"}}},{"node":{"description":"Guess what? Chemistry isn’t the only high school course built on a  foundation of lies.  In art class we’re taught that the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. Not only is it wrong to say that there are three true primary colors, but if we  were  to pick three, we’d pick a better combination. Let there be light A band of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum between 390nm and 700nm makes up the  visible spectrum of light ; we perceive different wavelengths within this spectrum as colors.  White light  is a combination of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Humans are  trichromats , which means that we have three types of color receptors ( cone cells ).

I had a hunch that it would end up sounding like garbage, and I was totally right. If you took the average color of a beautiful painting, it would likely turn out poo brown. Today, I created the audio equivalent: Blazo’s Misty Sapphire : Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians : Kill the Noise remix of KOAN Sound’s Talk Box : These first tones were generated using the powerful, free, cross-platform audio software  Audacity  and a cool lisp-y language called  Nyquist .

The rules are simple: Get a blog Write on said blog at least once a week Failing completion of #2, be humiliated and ostracized. Also, forfeit $5. I don’t think that we’ve decided on where the money is going yet; I’m hoping for giant Iron Blogger belt buckles. Of course I’ll do that! At the start of the batch I vowed to avoid any projects focusing on front-end design work, including a personal site. Oops. I also vowed to try my hand at blogging; breaking one vow to fulfill the other can’t be that bad, right? I made an addendum, stating that I could spend exactly  two  days making a site… and here we are!
