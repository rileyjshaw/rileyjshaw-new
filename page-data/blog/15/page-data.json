They allow us to make transistors , which allow us to make integrated circuits, which allow us to build calculators and flight control systems and iPads. The transistor is the unequivocal poster child of semiconductor physics. It was developed in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs. It may have far-reaching significance in electronics and electrical communication. This post is not about the transistor. It’s about the beginning of an industry that has changed the way we communicate. It’s also sort of about capitalism.

Get a small rubber washer about 3/8 inches inner diameter, 1/2 inch outer diameter, and 1/8 inch thick. Remove the  RESET  keytop as shown in Figure 2-9. Work the washer over the exposed square flange of the keyshaft as shown in Figure 2-10. Replace the keytop. Sometimes, all you need is a small rubber washer.","more":false,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["hardware","quote"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_ACCIDENTAL_RESET","slug":"/blog/accidental-reset","title":"Accidental reset","date":"2014-04-14"}}},{"node":{"description":"From  Learn C The Hard Way : I’m going to guess that you come from a language for weaklings. One of those “usable” languages that lets you get away with sloppy thinking and half-assed hackery like Python or Ruby. Or, maybe you use a language like Lisp that pretends the computer is some purely functional fantasy land with padded walls for little babies. Maybe you’ve learned Prolog and you think the entire world should just be a database that you walk around in looking for clues. Even worse, I’m betting you’ve been using an IDE, so your brain is riddled with memory holes and you can’t even type out an entire function’s name without hitting CTRL-SPACE every 3 characters you type.

I was recently browsing a beautiful red monochrome  site. There were a few call-to-action buttons on the page that transitioned to green on hover. Where did that brown come from?! The initial red looks great, the final green looks great, but everything between is pretty dismal. Why is that? The RGB color model R ed  G reen and  B lue are the  three primary additive colors . Your browser takes an 8-bit intensity value for each of the R, G, and B components to determine the output color. This is often represented as three two-digit hex values (for example,  #ff8800  is orange). For the subtle changes that make up 90% of color…","more":true,"frontmatter":{"layout":"post","tags":["color","css","javascript","web"]},"fields":{"uid":"POST_HUE_ANGLE_TRANSITIONS","slug":"/blog/hue-angle-transitions","title":"Hue-angle transitions","date":"2014-03-31"}}},{"node":{"description":"Guess what? Chemistry isn’t the only high school course built on a  foundation of lies.  In art class we’re taught that the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. Not only is it wrong to say that there are three true primary colors, but if we  were  to pick three, we’d pick a better combination. Let there be light A band of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum between 390nm and 700nm makes up the  visible spectrum of light ; we perceive different wavelengths within this spectrum as colors.
