The site was a sandbox to dump anything I happened to build / write / imagine while attending Hacker School, and an /about page seemed limiting. As the site grew, it grew weirder. I decided that its lack of context was an asset. I have some free usertesting.com recordings from 2015 that prove the site made no sense. I loved them.</p>\n<p>But the real reason I never had an /about page is that I didn't want to talk about myself.</p>\n<p>Exactly a year ago, I <a href=\"/blog/i-have-a-new-blog/\">retired my portfolio page</a>. I've recently begun applying for grants, and having some context on who is behind this site is important.</p>\n<p>The real problem is that this site is old; an /about page is an easy stopgap. This site does not represent me well anymore; I don't know why I still have links to my blog, for example. I would like to strip the site down, and think about the intended audience. But that sort of thing takes time, and I'm making the conscious decision to not prioritize my personal site for now.</p>\n<p>There are many technical goals I would keep in mind if I were to rebuild my website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cut dependencies and bundle size to make things faster.</li>\n<li>Move off of Ruby, Jekyll, Bower, and Grunt.</li>\n<li>Do <em>not</em> center particular frameworks or technologies on the new site.\n<ul>\n<li>Reorganize the file structure to be more modular and declarative. <code>_data/lab/*</code> is a great example.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Have it available over the dat:// protocol, and accessible offline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And I'd like to keep it weird.</p>","more":true},{"uid":"COMMIT_477E923EFCD46FF16DE4677A80E0846B310973A5","title":"Initial commit","date":"2019-02-19","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/miseryco/curriculum/477e923efcd46ff16de4677a80e0846b310973a5","repo":"miseryco/curriculum","description":null,"more":null},{"uid":"COMMIT_640CEC9613AA6DC284D953591545FFFF5CF6B0FF","title":"the basement flooded.. :(","date":"2018-11-19","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/herlifeinpixels/voxels/640cec9613aa6dc284d953591545ffff5cf6b0ff","repo":"herlifeinpixels/voxels","description":null,"more":null}]}},"pageContext":{"internalLimit":1,"internalSkip":2,"externalLimit":4,"externalSkip":13,"numPages":13,"currentPage":4}}}
