It worked for me!</p>\n<p>But I planned to eventually make an easier way to browse existing experiments. It would benefit me a bit, and casual viewers a lot.</p>\n<p>I haven't updated this repository in nearly two years, and I honestly never expect to again. I'm doing less browser-based creative coding these days, and trying to stretch my work in other directions.</p>\n<p>About an hour ago, I decided to create an index page or dropdown to close this project out and keep it accessible in perpetuity. When I cloned the repo and started looking at the build pipeline, I almost noped the whole idea. I built this with <code>create-react-app</code>, so even adding new pages for each project <em>the recommended way</em> involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installing some sort of React-compliant router.</li>\n<li>Spending… hours? figuring out which version of which router works with the project's outdated dependencies, OR,</li>\n<li>Upgrading the entire project, likely involving major upgrades to Webpack, Babel, etc.</li>\n<li>Installing something called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">react-snapshot</a>, which apparently builds static files for you? But there's still a <code>pushState</code> history API? The README listed some tutorials, so I opened them.</li>\n<li>…once I'd reached this point, I realized I'd need another method if I wanted to be done within the hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At that point, I could have searched the web for \"create-react-app static routes 2017 easy\" and gone down that rabbit hole before giving up. OR, I could have given up immediately. Or I could do what I did, which was a good idea:</p>\n<p>I changed the root component 38 times by hand, typed \"npm run build\" into my terminal by hand, and dragged the built files BY HAND into unique directories that I created BY HAND.</p>\n<p>Gasp!</p>\n<p>I spent another minute in my editor surrounding the output of <code>ls -d</code> with anchor tags for a root index. (yes, by hand)</p>\n<p>The most time-intensive part of the process was writing this commit message. I'm confident if I'd tried to automate the process or rebuilt the project \"the right way\", I'd be at this for a few more hours.</p>\n<p>The result is a little sketchy. Namely, I'm sure the total payload of each page is a bit bigger, and caching takes a hit. But I think an extra kilobyte will be tolerated by the 3 people who ever visit this corner of my website.</p>\n<p>And wow it was so easy. And if I ever decide to add a new sketch, I can do the same simple steps by hand. No dependency mismatch with my local versions. No reading old docs. Just build, drag, repeat, forever.</p>\n<p>I guess I'm writing this as a reminder to myself: it's usually possible to break back out to 1995 in a pinch.</p>","more":true},{"uid":"COMMIT_5BD325E113AC998737005467529F93AED8791F45","title":"Add Dwitter data and some initial scraper options","date":"2019-08-06","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io/5bd325e113ac998737005467529f93aed8791f45","repo":"rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io","description":"<p>I love the tidal wave of projects on <a href=\"/lab\">/lab</a>, and I want to emphasize that for v3.0 of the website.
