Each motion of your arm, hand, and fingers is reproduced at another place by mobile, mechanical drones<strike>hands.</strike> Light, dexterous, and strong, these drones<strike>hands</strike> have their own sensors through which you see and feel what is happening. Using this instrument, you can &ldquo;work&rdquo; in another room, in another city, in another country, or on another planet. Your remote presence possesses the strength of a giant or the delicacy of a surgeon. Heat or pain is translated into informative but tolerable sensation. <b>Your dangerous job becomes safe and pleasant.</b><br/></p><p>…</p><p>Telepresence is not science fiction. We could have a remote controlled economy by the twenty first century if we start planning right now. <b>The technical scope of such a project would be no greater than that of designing a new military aircraft.</b></p><p>A genuine telepresence system requires new ways to sense the various motions of a person<strike>’s hands</strike>. This means new motors, sensors, and lightweight actuators. Prototypes will be complex, but as designs mature, much of that complexity will move from hardware to easily copied computer software. The first ten years of telepresence research will see the development of basic instruments: geometry, mechanics, sensors, effectors, and control theory and its human interface. During the second decade we will work to make the instruments rugged, reliable, and natural.</p><hr><p>i hate reading this. he’s so <i>excited</i> about it. engineers need to think harder about what they propose. and “great engineers” rarely deserve the title.<br/></p>","more":true}]}},"pageContext":{"internalLimit":0,"internalSkip":3,"externalLimit":5,"externalSkip":17,"numPages":13,"currentPage":5}}}
