Even different servos of the same model might vary a bit. Currently, the Arduino Servo library has a severely restricted hard limit on the pulse widths that can be sent to servos. Specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum pulse width must be between [32, 1052].</li>\n<li>Maximum pulse width must be between [1888, 2908].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many popular servos have min/max pulse widths that fall in that unavailable range between (1052, 1888). For instance, the <a href=\"https://parallax.com/sites/default/files/downloads/900-00360-Feedback-360-HS-Servo-v1.2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Parallax Feedback 360° High-Speed Servo</a> operates between [1280, 1720].</p>\n<p>Before this commit, each instance of <code>Servo</code> stored their <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> values as <code>int8_t</code>. Since that only leaves room for values in the range [-128, 127], it can't store meaningful servo pulse widths, which are typically in the ~[1000, 2000]µs range. To compensate, <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> store the distance from the default values, divided by 4…</p>\n<p>There are two problems with this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first, mentioned above, is that you can never stray more than 512µs from <code>MIN_PULSE_WIDTH</code> and <code>MAX_PULSE_WIDTH</code>.</li>\n<li>The second is that unexpected and unnecessary rounding occurs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Simply storing <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> as <code>uint16_t</code> and using the values directly solves this problem, and reduces the complexity involved in working around it. This commit makes the library faster, and allows it to work with a wider range of servos. It also fixes some subtle bugs where the minimum value was hardcoded to <code>MIN_PULSE_WIDTH</code>.</p>\n<p>Tested on an Arduino Uno with a <a href=\"http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE1_EE/stores/sg90_datasheet.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tower Pro Micro Servo SG90</a>, and a <a href=\"https://parallax.com/sites/default/files/downloads/900-00360-Feedback-360-HS-Servo-v1.2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Parallax Feedback 360° High-Speed Servo</a>.</p>","more":true},{"uid":"COMMIT_AC98244CC4F551C3BE62F62340E13BF50B89F508","title":"Update `performance.now()` compatibility table to match rest of article","date":"2019-04-05","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/browser-compat-data/ac98244cc4f551c3be62f62340e13bf50b89f508","repo":"rileyjshaw/browser-compat-data","description":"<p>As mentioned in <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Firefox started rounding to 1 millisecond in Firefox 60.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This commit updates the <code>performance.now()</code> compatibility table to match the rest of the article.</p>","more":false},{"uid":"COMMIT_CB0D305F163E53E0D964AC7D9C102C407FF04F7D","title":"Add an /about page","date":"2019-03-06","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io/cb0d305f163e53e0d964ac7d9c102c407ff04f7d","repo":"rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io","description":"<p>Well, it's time.</p>\n<p>When I made this website, I decided against adding an /about page.
