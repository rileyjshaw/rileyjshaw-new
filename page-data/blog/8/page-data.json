it would corrupt the receiver&rsquo;s understanding of all future communication. the (initial | confirmation) sound should be unique so it always marks the start of a new shape. dragging the (cup | ball) in a double circle works.</p>","more":true},{"uid":"COMMIT_981204B86E730B08A8805A031FC74C199CC7B445","title":"v2.0.0","date":"2017-12-14","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/average-color/981204b86e730b08a8805a031fc74c199cc7b445","repo":"rileyjshaw/average-color","description":"<p>The previous version of this library assumed use on RGB native platforms, eg. web browsers.
