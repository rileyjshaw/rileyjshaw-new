I also get distracted by Expectations, especially around my Engineering Career.</p><p>In 2014 I was working at a startup without a purpose whatsoever. I left to join Khan Academy, a free education nonprofit. I felt good about that.</p><p>A few years have gone by and I feel a similar pull. I&rsquo;ve lost my idealism for nonprofits; they&rsquo;re subject to the same restrictive evaluation metrics and organizational patterns as any corporation.</p><p>(Dang, that sucks.)</p><p>I see art as a way to effect change outside of the rigid hierarchical structures of Work. It&rsquo;s a chance to connect on a different level; to surprise, engage, and hopefully, to shine light on something better.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to recalibrate… again. I wrote a little poem called &ldquo;whoami&rdquo; below. I want to work with more expressive languages.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>#!/usr/bin/env python<br/>from subprocess import Popen as ask, PIPE as rain; for_truth_in = bool</p><p>id  = &lsquo;my&rsquo; in'stinctual impulse&rsquo;<br/>for all_my_be in'g&rsquo;:<br/>    there = 'more to&rsquo;.find(&ldquo;) - (id is not 'critical&rsquo; or 'moralizing&rsquo;)<br/>superego = there</p><p>ego = i = ask('whoami&rsquo;, stdout=rain)<br/>for days in ['the rain&rsquo;]: i = i.stdout</p><p>reflection = (word for word in [<br/>    'oh, the places you'll go&rsquo; in 'the summer&rsquo;,<br/>    'the art of electronics&rsquo; in 'uni&rsquo;,<br/>    'the lean startup&rsquo; in 'my dark days&rsquo;,<br/>    'the one room schoolhouse&rsquo; in 'that idealistic edtech phase&rsquo;,<br/>    &rdquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    'and so on.&rsquo;<br/>])</p><p>found = not 'yet&rsquo;</p><p>while not found:<br/>    found = i.read(for_truth_in(next(reflection)))</p><p>i = found + ego.communicate()[id][:superego]<br/>print i</p><hr><h2>What do you want the School for Poetic Computation to be?</h2><p>APPROACHING IDEAS WITH THOUGHTFULNESS<br/>=====================================</p><p>I&rsquo;m familiar with some of the technical methods we&rsquo;ll cover over the term. This is exciting; re-approaching them intentionally through an artistic lens might help me break forgotten assumptions. So rather than focusing on *how* to build a Markov chain, I want to explore *why* I&rsquo;d build one.</p><p>I went to Recurse Center in 2014 because I wanted to collaborate with people outside of rigid project structures. I want to explore and build new frameworks now. I hope SFPC can help me rebuild my conceptions around the words &ldquo;technical&rdquo;, &ldquo;art&rdquo;, and &ldquo;project&rdquo;.</p><p>A STUDY IN EDUCATION<br/>====================</p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past few years learning about education. I&rsquo;ve formed opinions and have even more questions now. I&rsquo;m interested in programs like SFPC that challenge the rigidity of institutional CS or Fine Arts programs.</p><p>I also love mentorship. I lead our formal mentorship program at Khan Academy, and teach as a volunteer at a few local organizations. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll learn more from my cohort than they learn from me, but when it&rsquo;s helpful I&rsquo;d like to pitch in.</p><p>ULTIMATELY,<br/>===========</p><p>I&rsquo;m excited to develop my artistic practice around folks that I&rsquo;ve admired for a really, really long time &lt;3</p><hr><h2>What would you like to make at SFPC?</h2><p>As you can see on <a href=\"/lab\">rileyjshaw.com/lab</a>, I&rsquo;ve made many little things. These days, I try to work slower. Rather than approaching SFPC with plans to create specific artifacts, I&rsquo;m more interested in the process. I would like to refine the way that I absorb and synthesize ideas. I want to listen a lot and make slow, deliberate progress toward this goal.</p><p>Here are some topics that I&rsquo;m interested in:</p><p>EDUCATION AND THE REINFORCEMENT OF CLASS STRUCTURES<br/>===================================================</p><p>Our formal education system creates adults who can&rsquo;t take care of themselves, and whose survival depends on capitalist class structures. Educated and non-educated citizens are trapped in this cycle. A post-class society needs modes of education that break these rigidly imposed hierarchies. What might that look like?</p><p>DELETION, PERMANENCE, AND CONSISTENCY<br/>=====================================</p><p>Silicon Valley likes to store data because it entrenches people in their past behaviors. Corporate culture&rsquo;s emphasis on consistency is ableist, colonizing, transphobic, and represents a growing discomfort with people&rsquo;s fluidity.</p><p>I hope someday to have an International Day of Deletion. How can we live more presently?</p><p>CORPORATE TOOLS<br/>===============</p><p>A Craigslist bot gives Sol LeWitt-style instructions to a community. A series of banner ads discourage consumerism. Challenging people&rsquo;s expectations around advertising and corporate tools may raise questions about the structures behind them.</p><p>Mechanical Turk, Google Ads, Ebay, promoted tweets… these tools enforce the goals and values of capitalism. Can they be used to break them?</p><p>MAKING FRIENDS!!!<br/>=================</p><p>I am especially excited for the chance to meet new people that I can work with deeply. Festivals like XOXO or Eyeo allow only fleeting glimpses of fellow weirdos. Collaborating and growing together as a cohort – supporting and challenging one-another – is what I&rsquo;m most excited about.</p><p>In every education program I&rsquo;ve been a part of so far, people have been the most important part.</p><hr><p>Well, that’s it. I was initially accepted into the Fall 2017 batch but deferred to finish  some important work at Khan Academy and transition stewardship of the programs I was looking after. In the past half-year I’ve learned a lot and changed a lot, and my application would look different if I were to write it today. But the heart of this – writing less code, more thoughtfully – is at least as true today as it was when I wrote this.<br/></p>","more":true}]}},"pageContext":{"internalLimit":1,"internalSkip":5,"externalLimit":4,"externalSkip":30,"numPages":15,"currentPage":8}},"staticQueryHashes":["3605882644"]}
