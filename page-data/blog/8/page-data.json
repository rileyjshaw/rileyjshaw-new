Each motion of your arm, hand, and fingers is reproduced at another place by mobile, mechanical drones<strike>hands.</strike> Light, dexterous, and strong, these drones<strike>hands</strike> have their own sensors through which you see and feel what is happening. Using this instrument, you can &ldquo;work&rdquo; in another room, in another city, in another country, or on another planet. Your remote presence possesses the strength of a giant or the delicacy of a surgeon. Heat or pain is translated into informative but tolerable sensation. <b>Your dangerous job becomes safe and pleasant.</b><br/></p><p>…</p><p>Telepresence is not science fiction. We could have a remote controlled economy by the twenty first century if we start planning right now. <b>The technical scope of such a project would be no greater than that of designing a new military aircraft.</b></p><p>A genuine telepresence system requires new ways to sense the various motions of a person<strike>’s hands</strike>. This means new motors, sensors, and lightweight actuators. Prototypes will be complex, but as designs mature, much of that complexity will move from hardware to easily copied computer software. The first ten years of telepresence research will see the development of basic instruments: geometry, mechanics, sensors, effectors, and control theory and its human interface. During the second decade we will work to make the instruments rugged, reliable, and natural.</p><hr><p>i hate reading this. he’s so <i>excited</i> about it. engineers need to think harder about what they propose. and “great engineers” rarely deserve the title.<br/></p>","more":true},{"uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_179678255817","title":"unhitching","date":"2018-03-31","link":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/179678255817/the-possibility-vital-for-life-of-unhitching","repo":null,"description":"<p>The possibility, vital for life, of unhitching, which consists… in grasping, during the brief intervals in which our species can bring itself to interrupt its hive-like activity, the essence of what it was and continues to be, below the threshold of thought and over and above society: in the contemplation of a mineral more beautiful than all our creations; in the scent that can be smelt at the heart of a lily and is more imbued with learning than all our books; or in the brief glance, heavy with patience, serenity and mutual forgiveness, that, through some involuntary understanding, one can sometimes exchange with a cat.</p><p>Claude Lévi-Strauss, “Tristes Tropiques”</p>","more":false},{"uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_172372422682","title":"making nothing","date":"2018-03-29","link":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/172372422682/making-nothing","repo":null,"description":"<p>here’s a post that i wrote during my second week here. now that the showcase is coming up, i need to start making a thing. guess i’d better put this up before that starts :)<br/></p><hr><p>one of my major goals during this program is to not make things.<br/></p><p><i>* silence. the sfpc showcase curators back away slowly to discuss what a mistake they’ve made. *</i></p><p>it’s okay, i’ll do the assignments and make a showcase project and all that. i’m still going to make things. it’s hard not to; i’ve already made a lot of Things since arriving, more than i’m comfortable with. but i’m celebrating all the things i think of that i don’t make.</p><p>during the binary numbers assignment, i came up with an idea to:</p><ul><li>map binary digits (bits) to piano keys</li><li>find binary numbers that resolve to nice chords</li><li>create a simple matching app that prompts players with a decimal number and celebrates when the correct chord is played</li></ul><p>i have a midi keyboard here, and i’ve <a href=\"https://github.com/rileyjshaw/keyboard-keyboard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">written</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/rileyjshaw/virtuoso\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/rileyjshaw/huemidity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">few</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/rileyjshaw/flubber\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">programs</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/rileyjshaw/synthesia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">already</a> that interface with it. throwing this sketch together would have been easy. tbh it would have been an easy way to show off in class too. but just by thinking it through, i’d already gotten as much out of it as i was ever going to. building it would have come from a compulsion, not from any actual question or need. and it would have taken time, and space. for what?<br/></p><p>there’s a passage in Madness, Rack, and Honey that i love:</p><blockquote><p>if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed.<br/></p></blockquote><p>moving to new york – even from a big city like toronto – i’m struck by the overabundance of <b>stuff</b> here. stuff to buy. stuff to eat. stuff to stuff your apartment with. it’s a good reminder that less can be more.<br/></p>","more":true}]}},"pageContext":{"internalLimit":0,"internalSkip":5,"externalLimit":5,"externalSkip":30,"numPages":16,"currentPage":8}},"staticQueryHashes":["3605882644"]}
