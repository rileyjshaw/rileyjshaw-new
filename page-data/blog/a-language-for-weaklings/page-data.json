One of those \"usable\" languages that lets you get away with sloppy thinking and half-assed hackery like Python or Ruby. Or, maybe you use a language like Lisp that pretends the computer is some purely functional fantasy land with padded walls for little babies. Maybe you've learned Prolog and you think the entire world should just be a database that you walk around in looking for clues. Even worse, I'm betting you've been using an IDE, so your brain is riddled with memory holes and you can't even type out an entire function's name without hitting CTRL-SPACE every 3 characters you type.\n<cite>Zed A.
