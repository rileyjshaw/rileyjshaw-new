It began,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Three months ago I was in Toronto, squeezing in one last show at The Rex before shipping off to New York.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had just finished <a href=\"https://www.hackerschool.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hacker School</a> and wanted to write a retrospective post. I also wanted to officially resign from the <a href=\"../iron-blogger/\">Iron Blogger</a> crew. But I was on a kiteboarding trip at the time, and the wind was picking up.</p>\n<p>My three preceding posts are shoddy. Two are <a href=\"../a-language-for-weaklings/\">short</a> <a href=\"../accidental-reset/\">quotes</a> from materials I'd been reading through. The <a href=\"../the-cat&#x27;s-whisker-detector/\">other</a> reads like an assignment. All three were started on Monday morning before check-ins because I didn't want to lose a bet.</p>\n<p>I'm glad that I have a blog now. It's a great way to share <a href=\"../window.clusterfuck/\">cool things that I've learned</a> and <a href=\"../taking-the-average-tone/\">silly things that I've done</a>, and I intend to keep writing when inspired. But I don't want to do this every week.</p>\n<p>My drafts folder is full of half-thoughts and evening projects, and I'm going to add a page to share these bits and pieces. I'm happy to keep my blog long-form and my portfolio sparse, but I need a container for the <a href=\"http://ushld.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weird stuff</a><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-speed-of-time\"><a href=\"#the-speed-of-time\" aria-label=\"the speed of time permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The speed of time</h2>\n<p>My year has gone by especially fast. This post is a time-machine to when I wrote,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m lucky that this year’s trip matched up with the end of Hacker School. Some of my best meditation happens out on the water, and I’m working through some big decisions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The biggest decision — \"what next?\" — has already been made. I spent the summer travelling then moved to Palo Alto with a great friend to work on a startup. I've had no impulse to revisit my blog until now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"but-what-about-hacker-school\"><a href=\"#but-what-about-hacker-school\" aria-label=\"but what about hacker school permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>...but what about Hacker School?</h2>\n<p>If I'm going to reflect on my experiences at Hacker School I'll do so in a separate post. I will say this, though: in those three months I met some of the kindest, most accepting people I've ever come across.
