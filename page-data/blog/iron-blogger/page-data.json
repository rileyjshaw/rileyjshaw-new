Also, forfeit $5.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I don't think that we've decided on where the money is going yet; I'm hoping for giant Iron Blogger belt buckles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"of-course-ill-do-that\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#of-course-ill-do-that\" aria-label=\"of course ill do that permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Of course I'll do that!</h2>\n<p>At the start of the batch I vowed to avoid any projects focusing on front-end design work, including a personal site.</p>\n<p>Oops.</p>\n<p>I also vowed to try my hand at blogging; breaking one vow to fulfill the other can't be that bad, right?

I threw my last one together during exam season a few summers ago to send out to employers, then promptly lost access to the server that it was on. I've done a lot since then but The Site Remained The Same, showcasing a bunch of work that I'd outgrown. Going through Google Analytics and seeing people flicking through my old portfolio made me really uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Though there's much more to be done, I'm happy with the way this new site is turning out. The build process was pretty cool; I made some things that could be handy for other would-be-bloggers. I'll definitely post about it soon, since, y'know, I have a blog now...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We stand today on the edge of a new frontier - the frontier of the blog - a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils - a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats.\n<cite>John F.
