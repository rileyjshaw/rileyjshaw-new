When you’re new and have questions it’s hard to know who to ask, when to ask, and how often to ask. Khan Academy makes this easy by giving every new hire an explicit mentor, along with the following rules:</p>\n<p><strong>Who to ask:</strong> Your mentor. If they don’t know the answer, they’ll know who knows the answer.</p>\n<p><strong>When to ask:</strong> Now.</p>\n<p><strong>How often to ask:</strong> Probably more often than you currently are.</p>\n<p>Having someone to relentlessly pester during my first few weeks was instrumental in getting up to speed quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"one-on-ones\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#one-on-ones\" aria-label=\"one on ones permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>One-on-ones</h2>\n<p>As soon as I arrived on my first day I went for a walk with my manager <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcia_lee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marcia</a><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>. We strolled around the block under the beautiful California sun and learned a bit about each other. She showed me where the nearest coffee shop was. She told me that if I <em>ever</em> had a problem someone would be there to help. It was a warm welcome that set the tone for the rest of the day. When I got back to my desk I scheduled three more walks<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy encourages these casual, personal meetings. You frequently see teammates heading outside to talk through a technical decision.

It’s a way of organizing the team across different axes.</p>\n<p>The gist: <em>Teams</em> represent areas of deep domain expertise like design or mobile. <em>Initiatives</em> are cross-functional major company goals, like “Launch an SAT guided study program”. <em>Projects</em> are like mini-initiatives; they’re scoped at 2-5 weeks and involve 1-3 people.</p>\n<p>I enjoy working within this framework. Everyone is on a functional team, so even though we’re spread across different projects we can pool our wisdom and make big decisions. Initiatives let us move toward big targets while projects help scope them down. My favorite part, though, is a side-effect: the support initiative.</p>\n<h2 id=\"support-rotations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#support-rotations\" aria-label=\"support rotations permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Support rotations</h2>\n<p>Every three weeks a group of developers enters their scheduled support rotation. On support, you kill bugs. Having a team dedicated to bugs means that everyone else can focus on moving ahead with their projects.</p>\n<p>New developers at Khan Academy start on support. <em>Every company should do this.</em> In the past I’ve felt guilty for swimming through the codebase at a new job, but on support that <em>was</em> my job! Tracking down bugs was a great way to learn my way around the stack while still contributing. As time went by I grew more confident and started taking on bigger bugs. It was a natural progression and made me confident in my ability to make changes<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anyone-can-fix-anything\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#anyone-can-fix-anything\" aria-label=\"anyone can fix anything permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Anyone can fix anything</h2>\n<p>At Khan Academy you don’t need permission to fix things.

Be the change that you wish to see in the code.</p>\n<p>I’ll admit that I was skeptical upon hearing this. “Fixing” a small bug can lead to chaos elsewhere if you’re not familiar with the system. As such, “anyone can fix anything” might have the corollary “anyone can break everything”.

When we make something extra-useful, we turn it into a <a href=\"http://khan.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standalone library</a> for anyone to use.</p>\n<p>It’s cool to work somewhere that loves open source. We’re receptive to experimenting with new technologies<sup id=\"fnref-9\"><a href=\"#fn-9\" class=\"footnote-ref\">9</a></sup>, and splitting our code into modular bits allows us to keep trying new things. We also have all sorts of contributors catching bugs and adding features for us. It’s useful and inspiring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"these-are-good-ideas\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#these-are-good-ideas\" aria-label=\"these are good ideas permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>These are good ideas!</h2>\n<p>Just as code reviews disperse knowledge through a team, tech companies should share their organizational processes. Collaborating as a team of software developers is a yet-unsolved problem, but things get better every day.</p>\n<p>So take this post as an organizational diff.
