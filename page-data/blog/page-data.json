It was the last day of the decade, and it felt momentous. But since there were still some glaring bugs and omissions, I decided to hedge the release behind a ‚ÄúTHIS SITE IS IN BETA‚Äù banner.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs the end of the year again. Though there are <em>still</em> design problems and omissions, the site is much further along than it was on initial release. Some highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/lab\">/lab</a> no-longer crashes Webkit based browsers (lol)</li>\n<li>I added <em>bunch</em> of new scrapers. Most recently: SoundCloud, Vimeo, and YouTube.</li>\n<li>The design is still uh‚Ä¶ getting there‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs at least simpler and more consistent now.</li>\n<li>I test-drove the blog and added some new features (like MDX!)</li>\n<li>I put a ton of meat on last year‚Äôs skelly bones. From [/about](<a href=\"/about%5D\">https://rileyjshaw.com/about]</a> to <a href=\"/lab\">/lab</a> to adding about 3x more quotes, this site is more substantial and chaotic than ever before.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been about 130 commits between the beta release and this one. It‚Äôs not much for a whole year, but fixing up my personal website felt pretty small and self-indulgent vs. everything else I was focusing on. And 130 is still plenty of work to call this beta version un-betafied!</p>\n<p>I was initially going to remove the banner on New Year‚Äôs Eve, but I‚Äôd rather do it early and spend the rest of the year offline. That feels like the biggest improvement in this whole feature list.</p>","more":true},{"uid":"COMMIT_76A558DFD30B60806E4D7CD42AB37EF0737C3F31","title":"Feature: add a SoundCloud song scraper","date":"2020-12-14","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io/76a558dfd30b60806e4d7cd42ab37ef0737c3f31","repo":"rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io","description":"<p>For now it‚Äôs mostly experiments and technical demos, but as I get braver I might start posting more music :)</p>","more":false},{"uid":"COMMIT_0CDFAD1D54B6CE4317EFC6775F67C9C12827BCD0","title":"Feature: add lazy loading to the lab","date":"2020-11-10","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io/0cdfad1d54b6ce4317efc6775f67c9c12827bcd0","repo":"rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io","description":"<p>This small, very important change has been in my working directory since January.
