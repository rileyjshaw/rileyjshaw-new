After these two commits, this feels like a completely different app. It‚Äôs so speedy!</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Last commit, I focused on eliminating unnecessary FontContainer re-renders. This wasn‚Äôt a big priority at first‚Ä¶ until I added Google‚Äôs catalog of &gt; 1000 fonts. Ever since, performance has crawled whenever that category is selected.</p>\n<p>I decided to tighten up my own render code first because I knew that after enclosing the list in a virtual scroller, performance would be okay enough. And then I‚Äôd be less motivated by the sluggish, practically unusable Google Fonts viewer.</p>\n<p>And I'm happy I did! <code>react-window</code> made a huge difference. With the improved render tree <em>and</em> virtualized scrolling, this app somehow makes loading, displaying, and live-editing the preview of &gt; 1000 webfonts pretty smooth.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<p>Specific big changes in this commit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enclose the preview grid in a virtualized scroller (<code>react-window</code>)</li>\n<li>Rework the font-loading pipeline to only download new fonts once they‚Äôre near the viewport</li>\n<li>Supporting UI and layout changes</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>There may be a performance edit: part 3, but‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs not much need for the time being.</p>","more":true},{"uid":"COMMIT_72201A443461111B48F84D142898ED6F4B756A97","title":"Improved version for 2021","date":"2021-02-18","link":"https://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/palette-test-tool/72201a443461111b48f84d142898ed6f4b756a97","repo":"rileyjshaw/palette-test-tool","description":"<p>I recently added a color channel splitter back into my site header, so I dusted off this project.

Though there are <em>still</em> design problems and omissions, the site is much further along than it was on initial release. Some highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/lab\">/lab</a> no-longer crashes Webkit based browsers (lol)</li>\n<li>I added <em>bunch</em> of new scrapers. Most recently: SoundCloud, Vimeo, and YouTube.</li>\n<li>The design is still uh‚Ä¶ getting there‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs at least simpler and more consistent now.</li>\n<li>I test-drove the blog and added some new features (like MDX!)</li>\n<li>I put a ton of meat on last year‚Äôs skelly bones.
