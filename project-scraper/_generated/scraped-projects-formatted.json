[eli](https://twitter.com/veryeli) and i used the attendee\ndirectory to generate a unique card for everyone (twitter login kept it private\n🔒). squares on your card were other attendees - if you met someone on your\ncard you got to check it off. we made it cuz we’re shy. most of it is in the\n`pre-2019` folder!\n\n2016: we made the cards prettier by pulling in people’s twitter photos and\ndoing imgmagick to them 🔮\n\n2017: no xoxo, no bingo… missed u all\n\n2018: xoxo was in the midst of changing their infrastructure, so i lost access\nto the attendee directory. [hannah](https://twitter.com/herlifeinpixels),\n[jason](https://twitter.com/justsomeguy) and i met in a cafe before the kickoff\nceremony and designed a static version with input from the community. hannah\nand jason made 25 icons in like two minutes, it was incredible!!!\n\n2019: i've been too cheap to get https://xoxo.bingo in previous years, but\n[andy](https://twitter.com/andymcmillan) noticed a thread on slack and hooked\nus up! thx andy.\n</code></pre>\n<p>leading up to xoxo2018, i realized we wouldn't have access to the new<br>\nattendee registry. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waxpancake\" rel=\"nofollow\">andy</a> and i<br>\ndiscussed ad-hoc private access and other ways to make it work, but it<br>\nwas too much. so hannah, jason and i made a static version with<br>\n\"achievements\" sourced from the slack community.</p>\n<p>it was fun to get excited about things specific to that year, like the<br>\npodcast airstream and the blue ox. and it's gonna be that way from now<br>\non! feel free to create an issue or msg on slack if you have ideas for<br>\nthis year's bingo squares.</p>\n<p>since it's staying a static site, i moved everything off of heroku.<br>\nall site content will live in <a href=\"./2019-and-on/\"><code>2019-and-on/</code></a>.</p>"

		"description": "<p>I started this repository in the spirit of OpenFrameworks and<br>\nTouchDesigner: I wanted all the libraries I might need close at hand,<br>\nwith a simple, abstracted API for drawing to , SVG, etc. I<br>\nwanted a personal playpen / pigpen to test ideas in.</p>\n<p>For that reason, I didn't need nice features like <em>routing</em> or <em>pages.</em><br>\n:) if I wanted to see an old sketch, I'd change the root component<br>\nand re-render. It worked for me!</p>\n<p>But I planned to eventually make an easier way to browse existing<br>\nexperiments. It would benefit me a bit, and casual viewers a lot.</p>\n<p>I haven't updated this repository in nearly two years, and I honestly<br>\nnever expect to again. I'm doing less browser-based creative coding<br>\nthese days, and trying to stretch my work in other directions.</p>\n<p>About an hour ago, I decided to create an index page or dropdown<br>\nto close this project out and keep it accessible in perpetuity. When I<br>\ncloned the repo and started looking at the build pipeline, I almost<br>\nnoped the whole idea. I built this with <code>create-react-app</code>, so even<br>\nadding new pages for each project <em>the recommended way</em> involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installing some sort of React-compliant router.</li>\n<li>Spending… hours? figuring out which version of which router<br>\nworks with the project's outdated dependencies, OR,</li>\n<li>Upgrading the entire project, likely involving major upgrades to<br>\nWebpack, Babel, etc.</li>\n<li>Installing something called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot\" rel=\"nofollow\">react-snapshot</a>,<br>\nwhich apparently builds static files for you? But there's still<br>\na <code>pushState</code> history API? The README listed some tutorials, so I<br>\nopened them.</li>\n<li>…once I'd reached this point, I realized I'd need another method if<br>\nI wanted to be done within the hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At that point, I could have searched the web for \"create-react-app<br>\nstatic routes 2017 easy\" and gone down that rabbit hole before giving<br>\nup. OR, I could have given up immediately. Or I could do what I did,<br>\nwhich was a good idea:</p>\n<p>I changed the root component 38 times by hand, typed \"npm run build\"<br>\ninto my terminal by hand, and dragged the built files BY HAND into<br>\nunique directories that I created BY HAND.</p>\n<p>Gasp!</p>\n<p>I spent another minute in my editor surrounding the output of <code>ls -d</code><br>\nwith anchor tags for a root index. (yes, by hand)</p>\n<p>The most time-intensive part of the process was writing this commit<br>\nmessage. I'm confident if I'd tried to automate the process or rebuilt<br>\nthe project \"the right way\", I'd be at this for a few more hours.</p>\n<p>The result is a little sketchy. Namely, I'm sure the total payload of<br>\neach page is a bit bigger, and caching takes a hit. But I think an<br>\nextra kilobyte will be tolerated by the 3 people who ever visit this<br>\ncorner of my website.</p>\n<p>And wow it was so easy. And if I ever decide to add a new sketch, I<br>\ncan do the same simple steps by hand. No dependency mismatch with my<br>\nlocal versions. No reading old docs. Just build, drag, repeat,<br>\nforever.</p>\n<p>I guess I'm writing this as a reminder to myself: it's usually<br>\npossible to break back out to 1995 in a pinch.</p>"

This had a few advantages:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Text content could be easy processed and manipulated (admittedly, I wasn't using this for anything).</li>\n<li>Toggling styles was as easy as adding and removing a  element from &lt;body&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In theory, this strategy would beat out almost every other style rule (some inline styles excepted). &lt;a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#cascading-order\"&gt;User &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; rules used to override author &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; rules&lt;/a&gt;, but Chrome &lt;a href=\"https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?revision=234007&amp;amp;view=revision\"&gt;no-longer does user stylesheets&lt;/a&gt;. I figured an aggressively &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; author stylesheet added at the very bottom of the page was pretty solid.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After some testing, I realized that &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; styles from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt; injection (along with chrome.tabs.insertCSS) actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; take precedence over author stylesheets. Since 3) was the key consideration for my original decision, I re-wrote the extension to inject a stylesheet from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This change in architecture had pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ Improved chance of dark theme winning out over author styles.\n+ Allowed styles to be applied before any other DOM is constructed, substantially reducing time-to-darkness.\n+ Simplified the callbacks between background.js and client.js, reduced code, and made the entire extension easier to reason about.\n\n- With 1) above, I could&amp;#39;ve handled variant rules (eg. specificityHelper) with a few regular expressions. Locking into a static stylesheet added some huge copypastas, tripling the size of main.css.\n- Injected stylesheets aren&amp;#39;t accessible once they&amp;#39;ve been added. Rather than &amp;quot;turning the styles off&amp;quot; like in 2), the best option was to add a toggle class to &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;.\n- Rewrites take time.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This commit was essentially a full rewrite, so I changed some smaller things while I was at it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Styles now look for :not(.off) instead of .on. This makes the default dark and avoids a Blinding White Flash before the class changes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added id specificity helpers; it&amp;#39;s discussed further in client.js:24.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Renamed some files for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came across some unfortunate Chromium bugs while working on this, which caused me to dive into that project. It&amp;#39;s huge! Lots of fun to poke around :)&lt;/p&gt;</li>\n</ol>"

		"description": "<h1>Project scraper</h1>\n<p>The projects on my site are automatically scraped and formatted at publish time<br>\nusing the scripts in this directory. Read more about my reasoning below, or<br>\nskip to the <a href=\"#structure\">directory structure</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>Gatsby's source and transformer plugins are powerful, and I used them in the<br>\ninitial development of this site. I eventually decided that separating my<br>\ncollection process would be good for flexibility, control, and offline work.</p>\n<h3>Flexibility</h3>\n<p>GraphQL's filters and transforms are powerful, and Gatsby's APIs add more<br>\noptions for how data is fetched, cached, and transformed. However, complicated<br>\nor non-standard data transforms and sanitization are much easier outside of<br>\nGatsby's ecosystem. For instance, the API starts to feel clunky for one-off<br>\ntreatment of specific content nodes,</p>\n<h3>Control</h3>\n<p>I've had a good experience with Gatsby but I may decide to migrate my site to<br>\nanother platform or format someday. Keeping my data entirely separate from the<br>\nfrom the site's framework makes migrating my data as easy as copy/pasting this<br>\ndirectory. It's just a few JS files!</p>\n<h3>Offline</h3>\n<p>Gatsby stores requests made through its source plugins in the <code>.cache</code><br>\ndirectory by default. The <code>.cache</code> directory is deleted after:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gatsby clean</code> is called.</li>\n<li><code>package.json</code> changes, for example a dependency is updated or added.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-config.js</code> changes, for example a plugin is added or modified.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-node.js</code> changes, for example if a new Node API is invoked.</li>\n<li>…etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found I was frequently triggering <code>.cache</code> wipes during development. At best<br>\nthis meant I was pinging APIs and atom feeds more than necessary. At worst, it<br>\nmade working offline with project data impossible.</p>\n<h2>Directory structure</h2>\n<p>Here's how the scraper is organized for now:</p>\n<pre><code>scrape-projects.js\n\tThe megafile to replace Gatsby's source plugins. This pulls project data\n\tfrom all online sources and saves them into `_generated/`.\n\n_generated/\n\tFiles generated by the `scrape-projects.js` above. DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES\n\tMANUALLY! They will be overwritten.\n\n\tscraped-projects-raw.json\n\t\tNot quite the raw response, but pretty close. This file\n\t\tcontains all the data that I may decide to use someday, but\n\t\thaven't yet. Organized by `type` in a nested object.\n\n    scraped-projects-formatted.json\n\t\tStandardized into a smaller format that can be smashed together with\n\t\t`curation/` data. Flattened into an array with `type` annotations on\n\t\teach node, as well as unique, unchanging project IDs (`UID`).\n\ncuration/\n\tThis is where all custom curation and processing go, eg. tagging content.\n\tProjects are modified based on their generated UID.\n\n\ttweaks.js\n\t\tMainly for one-off changes eg. fixing formatting errors from immutable\n\t\tonline sources. This file can also be used to apply changes on groups\n\t\tof files.\n\n\ttags.js\n\t\tTODO: figure out where `tags`, `lastTagged`, and `coolness` data are\n\t\tgoing to live.\n\nsources/\n\tOffline data files and collections to compliment the online data cached in\n\t`_generated/`.\n\n\tstandalone-projects.json\n\t\tTODO: Move these over from the `src/data` directory.\n\ntools/\n\tCustom tools to help classify, organize, or edit project nodes without\n\topening a text editor. Custom tools are only built for data that is too\n\tdifficult to keep updated or standardized manually.\n\tTODO: Hook these up to a Node server so they edit the JSON files directly.\n\n\ttagger.html\n\t\tFinds untagged or incorrectly tagged projects, as well as projects\n\t\tthat were last tagged before a new tag type was added. Provides an\n\t\tinterface to preview and re-tag each project.\n\n\tcool-sort.html\n\t\tTODO: sort or insert nodes based on their \"coolness\".\n\ntest/\n\tQuick test files to ensure data is downloaded without any dropped nodes,\n\tUIDs are unique, etc.\n</code></pre>"

Using this instrument, you can &ldquo;work&rdquo; in another room, in another city, in another country, or on another planet.

This means new motors, sensors, and lightweight actuators. Prototypes will be complex, but as designs mature, much of that complexity will move from hardware to easily copied computer software. The first ten years of telepresence research will see the development of basic instruments: geometry, mechanics, sensors, effectors, and control theory and its human interface. During the second decade we will work to make the instruments rugged, reliable, and natural.</p><hr><p>i hate reading this. he’s so <i>excited</i> about it. engineers need to think harder about what they propose. and “great engineers” rarely deserve the title.<br/></p>"

That involves learning about the folx involved. I hope this post helps a future SFPC attendee get started on their application.<br/></p><p>If you’ve landed here from a search and are considering applying, I recommend doing so! It’s fun here and the people are nice.</p><hr><p><b>A disclaimer  before we get into it:</b> everyone who goes through SFPC comes from different backgrounds. If you see something on my application that you haven’t experienced, please don’t take it as a requirement. Batches are carefully selected to include different perspectives and skillsets. And you’re awesome 💕<br/></p><hr><h2>Why do you want to study at SFPC at this point in your life?<br/></h2><p>I love making art! But when I use computers, I can get distracted by Technical Shinys. I also get distracted by Expectations, especially around my Engineering Career.</p><p>In 2014 I was working at a startup without a purpose whatsoever. I left to join Khan Academy, a free education nonprofit. I felt good about that.</p><p>A few years have gone by and I feel a similar pull. I&rsquo;ve lost my idealism for nonprofits; they&rsquo;re subject to the same restrictive evaluation metrics and organizational patterns as any corporation.</p><p>(Dang, that sucks.)</p><p>I see art as a way to effect change outside of the rigid hierarchical structures of Work. It&rsquo;s a chance to connect on a different level; to surprise, engage, and hopefully, to shine light on something better.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to recalibrate… again. I wrote a little poem called &ldquo;whoami&rdquo; below. I want to work with more expressive languages.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>#!/usr/bin/env python<br/>from subprocess import Popen as ask, PIPE as rain; for_truth_in = bool</p><p>id  = &lsquo;my&rsquo; in'stinctual impulse&rsquo;<br/>for all_my_be in'g&rsquo;:<br/>    there = 'more to&rsquo;.find(&ldquo;) - (id is not 'critical&rsquo; or 'moralizing&rsquo;)<br/>superego = there</p><p>ego = i = ask('whoami&rsquo;, stdout=rain)<br/>for days in ['the rain&rsquo;]: i = i.stdout</p><p>reflection = (word for word in [<br/>    'oh, the places you'll go&rsquo; in 'the summer&rsquo;,<br/>    'the art of electronics&rsquo; in 'uni&rsquo;,<br/>    'the lean startup&rsquo; in 'my dark days&rsquo;,<br/>    'the one room schoolhouse&rsquo; in 'that idealistic edtech phase&rsquo;,<br/>    &rdquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    'and so on.&rsquo;<br/>])</p><p>found = not 'yet&rsquo;</p><p>while not found:<br/>    found = i.read(for_truth_in(next(reflection)))</p><p>i = found + ego.communicate()[id][:superego]<br/>print i</p><hr><h2>What do you want the School for Poetic Computation to be?</h2><p>APPROACHING IDEAS WITH THOUGHTFULNESS<br/>=====================================</p><p>I&rsquo;m familiar with some of the technical methods we&rsquo;ll cover over the term. This is exciting; re-approaching them intentionally through an artistic lens might help me break forgotten assumptions. So rather than focusing on *how* to build a Markov chain, I want to explore *why* I&rsquo;d build one.</p><p>I went to Recurse Center in 2014 because I wanted to collaborate with people outside of rigid project structures. I want to explore and build new frameworks now. I hope SFPC can help me rebuild my conceptions around the words &ldquo;technical&rdquo;, &ldquo;art&rdquo;, and &ldquo;project&rdquo;.</p><p>A STUDY IN EDUCATION<br/>====================</p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past few years learning about education. I&rsquo;ve formed opinions and have even more questions now. I&rsquo;m interested in programs like SFPC that challenge the rigidity of institutional CS or Fine Arts programs.</p><p>I also love mentorship. I lead our formal mentorship program at Khan Academy, and teach as a volunteer at a few local organizations. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll learn more from my cohort than they learn from me, but when it&rsquo;s helpful I&rsquo;d like to pitch in.</p><p>ULTIMATELY,<br/>===========</p><p>I&rsquo;m excited to develop my artistic practice around folks that I&rsquo;ve admired for a really, really long time &lt;3</p><hr><h2>What would you like to make at SFPC?</h2><p>As you can see on <a href=\"https://rileyjshaw.com/lab\">rileyjshaw.com/lab</a>, I&rsquo;ve made many little things. These days, I try to work slower. Rather than approaching SFPC with plans to create specific artifacts, I&rsquo;m more interested in the process. I would like to refine the way that I absorb and synthesize ideas. I want to listen a lot and make slow, deliberate progress toward this goal.</p><p>Here are some topics that I&rsquo;m interested in:</p><p>EDUCATION AND THE REINFORCEMENT OF CLASS STRUCTURES<br/>===================================================</p><p>Our formal education system creates adults who can&rsquo;t take care of themselves, and whose survival depends on capitalist class structures. Educated and non-educated citizens are trapped in this cycle. A post-class society needs modes of education that break these rigidly imposed hierarchies. What might that look like?</p><p>DELETION, PERMANENCE, AND CONSISTENCY<br/>=====================================</p><p>Silicon Valley likes to store data because it entrenches people in their past behaviors. Corporate culture&rsquo;s emphasis on consistency is ableist, colonizing, transphobic, and represents a growing discomfort with people&rsquo;s fluidity.</p><p>I hope someday to have an International Day of Deletion. How can we live more presently?</p><p>CORPORATE TOOLS<br/>===============</p><p>A Craigslist bot gives Sol LeWitt-style instructions to a community. A series of banner ads discourage consumerism. Challenging people&rsquo;s expectations around advertising and corporate tools may raise questions about the structures behind them.</p><p>Mechanical Turk, Google Ads, Ebay, promoted tweets… these tools enforce the goals and values of capitalism. Can they be used to break them?</p><p>MAKING FRIENDS!!!<br/>=================</p><p>I am especially excited for the chance to meet new people that I can work with deeply. Festivals like XOXO or Eyeo allow only fleeting glimpses of fellow weirdos. Collaborating and growing together as a cohort – supporting and challenging one-another – is what I&rsquo;m most excited about.</p><p>In every education program I&rsquo;ve been a part of so far, people have been the most important part.</p><hr><p>Well, that’s it. I was initially accepted into the Fall 2017 batch but deferred to finish  some important work at Khan Academy and transition stewardship of the programs I was looking after. In the past half-year I’ve learned a lot and changed a lot, and my application would look different if I were to write it today. But the heart of this – writing less code, more thoughtfully – is at least as true today as it was when I wrote this.<br/></p>"
