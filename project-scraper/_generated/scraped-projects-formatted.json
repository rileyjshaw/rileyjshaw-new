[eli](https://twitter.com/veryeli) and i used the attendee\ndirectory to generate a unique card for everyone (twitter login kept it private\n🔒). squares on your card were other attendees - if you met someone on your\ncard you got to check it off. we made it cuz we’re shy. most of it is in the\n`pre-2019` folder!\n\n2016: we made the cards prettier by pulling in people’s twitter photos and\ndoing imgmagick to them 🔮\n\n2017: no xoxo, no bingo… missed u all\n\n2018: xoxo was in the midst of changing their infrastructure, so i lost access\nto the attendee directory. [hannah](https://twitter.com/herlifeinpixels),\n[jason](https://twitter.com/justsomeguy) and i met in a cafe before the kickoff\nceremony and designed a static version with input from the community. hannah\nand jason made 25 icons in like two minutes, it was incredible!!!\n\n2019: i've been too cheap to get https://xoxo.bingo in previous years, but\n[andy](https://twitter.com/andymcmillan) noticed a thread on slack and hooked\nus up! thx andy.\n</code></pre>\n<p>leading up to xoxo2018, i realized we wouldn't have access to the new<br>\nattendee registry. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waxpancake\" rel=\"nofollow\">andy</a> and i<br>\ndiscussed ad-hoc private access and other ways to make it work, but it<br>\nwas too much. so hannah, jason and i made a static version with<br>\n\"achievements\" sourced from the slack community.</p>\n<p>it was fun to get excited about things specific to that year, like the<br>\npodcast airstream and the blue ox. and it's gonna be that way from now<br>\non! feel free to create an issue or msg on slack if you have ideas for<br>\nthis year's bingo squares.</p>\n<p>since it's staying a static site, i moved everything off of heroku.<br>\nall site content will live in <a href=\"./2019-and-on/\"><code>2019-and-on/</code></a>.</p>"},{"uid":"COMMIT_F117F4FAA75DCA5FA109BAC066ADB3B3EE5C6CF7","type":"commit","title":"Firehose: proof of concept","date":"2019-7-9","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw-new/f117f4faa75dca5fa109bac066adb3b3ee5c6cf7","description":"<p>I'm experimenting with auto-generating nodes for<br>\n<a href=\"https://rileyjshaw.com/lab\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://rileyjshaw.com/lab</a> from a variety of data sources.

It worked for me!</p>\n<p>But I planned to eventually make an easier way to browse existing<br>\nexperiments. It would benefit me a bit, and casual viewers a lot.</p>\n<p>I haven't updated this repository in nearly two years, and I honestly<br>\nnever expect to again. I'm doing less browser-based creative coding<br>\nthese days, and trying to stretch my work in other directions.</p>\n<p>About an hour ago, I decided to create an index page or dropdown<br>\nto close this project out and keep it accessible in perpetuity. When I<br>\ncloned the repo and started looking at the build pipeline, I almost<br>\nnoped the whole idea. I built this with <code>create-react-app</code>, so even<br>\nadding new pages for each project <em>the recommended way</em> involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installing some sort of React-compliant router.</li>\n<li>Spending… hours? figuring out which version of which router<br>\nworks with the project's outdated dependencies, OR,</li>\n<li>Upgrading the entire project, likely involving major upgrades to<br>\nWebpack, Babel, etc.</li>\n<li>Installing something called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot\" rel=\"nofollow\">react-snapshot</a>,<br>\nwhich apparently builds static files for you? But there's still<br>\na <code>pushState</code> history API? The README listed some tutorials, so I<br>\nopened them.</li>\n<li>…once I'd reached this point, I realized I'd need another method if<br>\nI wanted to be done within the hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At that point, I could have searched the web for \"create-react-app<br>\nstatic routes 2017 easy\" and gone down that rabbit hole before giving<br>\nup. OR, I could have given up immediately. Or I could do what I did,<br>\nwhich was a good idea:</p>\n<p>I changed the root component 38 times by hand, typed \"npm run build\"<br>\ninto my terminal by hand, and dragged the built files BY HAND into<br>\nunique directories that I created BY HAND.</p>\n<p>Gasp!</p>\n<p>I spent another minute in my editor surrounding the output of <code>ls -d</code><br>\nwith anchor tags for a root index. (yes, by hand)</p>\n<p>The most time-intensive part of the process was writing this commit<br>\nmessage. I'm confident if I'd tried to automate the process or rebuilt<br>\nthe project \"the right way\", I'd be at this for a few more hours.</p>\n<p>The result is a little sketchy. Namely, I'm sure the total payload of<br>\neach page is a bit bigger, and caching takes a hit. But I think an<br>\nextra kilobyte will be tolerated by the 3 people who ever visit this<br>\ncorner of my website.</p>\n<p>And wow it was so easy. And if I ever decide to add a new sketch, I<br>\ncan do the same simple steps by hand. No dependency mismatch with my<br>\nlocal versions. No reading old docs. Just build, drag, repeat,<br>\nforever.</p>\n<p>I guess I'm writing this as a reminder to myself: it's usually<br>\npossible to break back out to 1995 in a pinch.</p>"},{"uid":"COMMIT_5BD325E113AC998737005467529F93AED8791F45","type":"commit","title":"Add Dwitter data and some initial scraper options","date":"2019-7-6","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw.github.io/5bd325e113ac998737005467529f93aed8791f45","description":"<p>I love the tidal wave of projects on <a href=\"https://rileyjshaw.com/lab\" rel=\"nofollow\">/lab</a>,<br>\nand I want to emphasize that for v3.0 of the website.

I figured an aggressively &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; author stylesheet added at the very bottom of the page was pretty solid.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After some testing, I realized that &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; styles from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt; injection (along with chrome.tabs.insertCSS) actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; take precedence over author stylesheets. Since 3) was the key consideration for my original decision, I re-wrote the extension to inject a stylesheet from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This change in architecture had pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ Improved chance of dark theme winning out over author styles.\n+ Allowed styles to be applied before any other DOM is constructed, substantially reducing time-to-darkness.\n+ Simplified the callbacks between background.js and client.js, reduced code, and made the entire extension easier to reason about.\n\n- With 1) above, I could&amp;#39;ve handled variant rules (eg. specificityHelper) with a few regular expressions. Locking into a static stylesheet added some huge copypastas, tripling the size of main.css.\n- Injected stylesheets aren&amp;#39;t accessible once they&amp;#39;ve been added. Rather than &amp;quot;turning the styles off&amp;quot; like in 2), the best option was to add a toggle class to &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;.\n- Rewrites take time.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This commit was essentially a full rewrite, so I changed some smaller things while I was at it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Styles now look for :not(.off) instead of .on. This makes the default dark and avoids a Blinding White Flash before the class changes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added id specificity helpers; it&amp;#39;s discussed further in client.js:24.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Renamed some files for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came across some unfortunate Chromium bugs while working on this, which caused me to dive into that project. It&amp;#39;s huge! Lots of fun to poke around :)&lt;/p&gt;</li>\n</ol>"},{"uid":"COMMIT_0167A91073922AC7B5018C6A73C894853DABBA56","type":"commit","title":"Remove numkey layout bindings","date":"2015-11-23","link":"http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/.supermac/0167a91073922ac7b5018c6a73c894853dabba56","description":"<p>1, 2, 3, and 4 are useful for app-specific bindings and should thus be reserved.</p>"},{"uid":"ARENA_HELL_SBGBXNMDLXI","type":"arenaChannel","title":"hell","date":"2019-05-30","link":"https://are.na/riley-shaw/hell-sbgbxnmdlxi","description":"","updatedAt":"2019-08-30"},{"uid":"ARENA_HW_U1LMOISDNYU","type":"arenaChannel","title":"hw","date":"2018-11-21","link":"https://are.na/riley-shaw/hw-u1lmoisdnyu","description":"","updatedAt":"2019-08-31"},{"uid":"ARENA_TILDE_QVDRQCJJOPM","type":"arenaChannel","title":"~","date":"2018-12-09","link":"https://are.na/riley-shaw/tilde-qvdrqcjjopm","updatedAt":"2019-08-29"},{"uid":"ARENA_SUAXBJVGLLS","type":"arenaChannel","title":"☀️🤘","date":"2018-11-04","link":"https://are.na/riley-shaw/suaxbjvglls","description":"","updatedAt":"2019-08-30"},{"uid":"DWEET_15311","type":"dweet","title":"No. 15311","date":"2019-08-06","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/15311"},{"uid":"DWEET_15308","type":"dweet","title":"No. 15308","date":"2019-08-06","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/15308"},{"uid":"DWEET_15303","type":"dweet","title":"No. 15303","date":"2019-08-06","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/15303"},{"uid":"DWEET_15271","type":"dweet","title":"No. 15271","date":"2019-08-03","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/15271"},{"uid":"DWEET_15270","type":"dweet","title":"No. 15270","date":"2019-08-03","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/15270"},{"uid":"DWEET_2621","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2621","date":"2017-04-27","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2621"},{"uid":"DWEET_2619","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2619","date":"2017-04-27","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2619"},{"uid":"DWEET_2618","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2618","date":"2017-04-27","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2618"},{"uid":"DWEET_2617","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2617","date":"2017-04-27","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2617"},{"uid":"DWEET_2613","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2613","date":"2017-04-27","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2613"},{"uid":"DWEET_2610","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2610","date":"2017-04-26","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2610"},{"uid":"DWEET_2609","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2609","date":"2017-04-26","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2609"},{"uid":"DWEET_2608","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2608","date":"2017-04-26","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2608"},{"uid":"DWEET_2605","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2605","date":"2017-04-26","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2605"},{"uid":"DWEET_2603","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2603","date":"2017-04-26","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2603"},{"uid":"DWEET_2602","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2602","date":"2017-04-26","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2602"},{"uid":"DWEET_2601","type":"dweet","title":"No. 2601","date":"2017-04-26","link":"https://www.dwitter.net/d/2601"}]
