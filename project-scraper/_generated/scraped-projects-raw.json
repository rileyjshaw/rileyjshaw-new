That involves learning about the folx involved. I hope this post helps a future SFPC attendee get started on their application.<br/></p><p>If you’ve landed here from a search and are considering applying, I recommend doing so! It’s fun here and the people are nice.</p><hr><p><b>A disclaimer  before we get into it:</b> everyone who goes through SFPC comes from different backgrounds. If you see something on my application that you haven’t experienced, please don’t take it as a requirement. Batches are carefully selected to include different perspectives and skillsets. And you’re awesome 💕<br/></p><hr><h2>Why do you want to study at SFPC at this point in your life?<br/></h2><p>I love making art! But when I use computers, I can get distracted by Technical Shinys. I also get distracted by Expectations, especially around my Engineering Career.</p><p>In 2014 I was working at a startup without a purpose whatsoever. I left to join Khan Academy, a free education nonprofit. I felt good about that.</p><p>A few years have gone by and I feel a similar pull. I&rsquo;ve lost my idealism for nonprofits; they&rsquo;re subject to the same restrictive evaluation metrics and organizational patterns as any corporation.</p><p>(Dang, that sucks.)</p><p>I see art as a way to effect change outside of the rigid hierarchical structures of Work. It&rsquo;s a chance to connect on a different level; to surprise, engage, and hopefully, to shine light on something better.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to recalibrate… again. I wrote a little poem called &ldquo;whoami&rdquo; below. I want to work with more expressive languages.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>#!/usr/bin/env python<br/>from subprocess import Popen as ask, PIPE as rain; for_truth_in = bool</p><p>id  = &lsquo;my&rsquo; in'stinctual impulse&rsquo;<br/>for all_my_be in'g&rsquo;:<br/>    there = 'more to&rsquo;.find(&ldquo;) - (id is not 'critical&rsquo; or 'moralizing&rsquo;)<br/>superego = there</p><p>ego = i = ask('whoami&rsquo;, stdout=rain)<br/>for days in ['the rain&rsquo;]: i = i.stdout</p><p>reflection = (word for word in [<br/>    'oh, the places you'll go&rsquo; in 'the summer&rsquo;,<br/>    'the art of electronics&rsquo; in 'uni&rsquo;,<br/>    'the lean startup&rsquo; in 'my dark days&rsquo;,<br/>    'the one room schoolhouse&rsquo; in 'that idealistic edtech phase&rsquo;,<br/>    &rdquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    'and so on.&rsquo;<br/>])</p><p>found = not 'yet&rsquo;</p><p>while not found:<br/>    found = i.read(for_truth_in(next(reflection)))</p><p>i = found + ego.communicate()[id][:superego]<br/>print i</p><hr><h2>What do you want the School for Poetic Computation to be?</h2><p>APPROACHING IDEAS WITH THOUGHTFULNESS<br/>=====================================</p><p>I&rsquo;m familiar with some of the technical methods we&rsquo;ll cover over the term. This is exciting; re-approaching them intentionally through an artistic lens might help me break forgotten assumptions. So rather than focusing on *how* to build a Markov chain, I want to explore *why* I&rsquo;d build one.</p><p>I went to Recurse Center in 2014 because I wanted to collaborate with people outside of rigid project structures. I want to explore and build new frameworks now. I hope SFPC can help me rebuild my conceptions around the words &ldquo;technical&rdquo;, &ldquo;art&rdquo;, and &ldquo;project&rdquo;.</p><p>A STUDY IN EDUCATION<br/>====================</p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past few years learning about education. I&rsquo;ve formed opinions and have even more questions now. I&rsquo;m interested in programs like SFPC that challenge the rigidity of institutional CS or Fine Arts programs.</p><p>I also love mentorship. I lead our formal mentorship program at Khan Academy, and teach as a volunteer at a few local organizations.
