That involves learning about the folx involved. I hope this post helps a future SFPC attendee get started on their application.<br/></p><p>If you’ve landed here from a search and are considering applying, I recommend doing so! It’s fun here and the people are nice.</p><hr><p><b>A disclaimer  before we get into it:</b> everyone who goes through SFPC comes from different backgrounds. If you see something on my application that you haven’t experienced, please don’t take it as a requirement. Batches are carefully selected to include different perspectives and skillsets. And you’re awesome 💕<br/></p><hr><h2>Why do you want to study at SFPC at this point in your life?<br/></h2><p>I love making art! But when I use computers, I can get distracted by Technical Shinys. I also get distracted by Expectations, especially around my Engineering Career.</p><p>In 2014 I was working at a startup without a purpose whatsoever. I left to join Khan Academy, a free education nonprofit. I felt good about that.</p><p>A few years have gone by and I feel a similar pull. I&rsquo;ve lost my idealism for nonprofits; they&rsquo;re subject to the same restrictive evaluation metrics and organizational patterns as any corporation.</p><p>(Dang, that sucks.)</p><p>I see art as a way to effect change outside of the rigid hierarchical structures of Work. It&rsquo;s a chance to connect on a different level; to surprise, engage, and hopefully, to shine light on something better.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to recalibrate… again. I wrote a little poem called &ldquo;whoami&rdquo; below. I want to work with more expressive languages.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>#!/usr/bin/env python<br/>from subprocess import Popen as ask, PIPE as rain; for_truth_in = bool</p><p>id  = &lsquo;my&rsquo; in'stinctual impulse&rsquo;<br/>for all_my_be in'g&rsquo;:<br/>    there = 'more to&rsquo;.find(&ldquo;) - (id is not 'critical&rsquo; or 'moralizing&rsquo;)<br/>superego = there</p><p>ego = i = ask('whoami&rsquo;, stdout=rain)<br/>for days in ['the rain&rsquo;]: i = i.stdout</p><p>reflection = (word for word in [<br/>    'oh, the places you'll go&rsquo; in 'the summer&rsquo;,<br/>    'the art of electronics&rsquo; in 'uni&rsquo;,<br/>    'the lean startup&rsquo; in 'my dark days&rsquo;,<br/>    'the one room schoolhouse&rsquo; in 'that idealistic edtech phase&rsquo;,<br/>    &rdquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    'and so on.&rsquo;<br/>])</p><p>found = not 'yet&rsquo;</p><p>while not found:<br/>    found = i.read(for_truth_in(next(reflection)))</p><p>i = found + ego.communicate()[id][:superego]<br/>print i</p><hr><h2>What do you want the School for Poetic Computation to be?</h2><p>APPROACHING IDEAS WITH THOUGHTFULNESS<br/>=====================================</p><p>I&rsquo;m familiar with some of the technical methods we&rsquo;ll cover over the term. This is exciting; re-approaching them intentionally through an artistic lens might help me break forgotten assumptions. So rather than focusing on *how* to build a Markov chain, I want to explore *why* I&rsquo;d build one.</p><p>I went to Recurse Center in 2014 because I wanted to collaborate with people outside of rigid project structures. I want to explore and build new frameworks now. I hope SFPC can help me rebuild my conceptions around the words &ldquo;technical&rdquo;, &ldquo;art&rdquo;, and &ldquo;project&rdquo;.</p><p>A STUDY IN EDUCATION<br/>====================</p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past few years learning about education. I&rsquo;ve formed opinions and have even more questions now. I&rsquo;m interested in programs like SFPC that challenge the rigidity of institutional CS or Fine Arts programs.</p><p>I also love mentorship. I lead our formal mentorship program at Khan Academy, and teach as a volunteer at a few local organizations.

I figured an aggressively &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; author stylesheet added at the very bottom of the page was pretty solid.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After some testing, I realized that &lt;code&gt;!important&lt;/code&gt; styles from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt; injection (along with chrome.tabs.insertCSS) actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; take precedence over author stylesheets. Since 3) was the key consideration for my original decision, I re-wrote the extension to inject a stylesheet from &lt;code&gt;content_scripts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This change in architecture had pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ Improved chance of dark theme winning out over author styles.\n+ Allowed styles to be applied before any other DOM is constructed, substantially reducing time-to-darkness.\n+ Simplified the callbacks between background.js and client.js, reduced code, and made the entire extension easier to reason about.\n\n- With 1) above, I could&amp;#39;ve handled variant rules (eg. specificityHelper) with a few regular expressions. Locking into a static stylesheet added some huge copypastas, tripling the size of main.css.\n- Injected stylesheets aren&amp;#39;t accessible once they&amp;#39;ve been added. Rather than &amp;quot;turning the styles off&amp;quot; like in 2), the best option was to add a toggle class to &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;.\n- Rewrites take time.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This commit was essentially a full rewrite, so I changed some smaller things while I was at it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Styles now look for :not(.off) instead of .on. This makes the default dark and avoids a Blinding White Flash before the class changes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added id specificity helpers; it&amp;#39;s discussed further in client.js:24.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Renamed some files for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came across some unfortunate Chromium bugs while working on this, which caused me to dive into that project. It&amp;#39;s huge! Lots of fun to poke around :)&lt;/p&gt;</li>\n</ol>"},"meta":{"#ns":[{"xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"}],"@":[{"xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"}],"#xml":{"version":"1.0","encoding":"utf-8"},"#type":"atom","#version":"1.0","title":"$
