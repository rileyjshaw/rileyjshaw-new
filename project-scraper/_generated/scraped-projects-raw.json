rel=\"nofollow\">https://rileyjshaw.com</a>. My old site is already mirrored at<br>\n<a href=\"https://v14.rileyjshaw.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://v14.rileyjshaw.com</a>, and will remain there.</p>\n<p>This commit also upgrades project dependencies, and adds a whole bunch of<br>\ncommit linters and hooks to keep commits consistent. Specifically, I added</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/typicode/husky\">Husky</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://commitlint.js.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">commitlint</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli\">Commitizen</a>, and</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conventional Commits</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>to keep commits easy and consistent.

Read more about my reasoning below, or<br>\nskip to the <a href=\"#structure\">directory structure</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>Gatsby's source and transformer plugins are powerful, and I used them in the<br>\ninitial development of this site. I eventually decided that separating my<br>\ncollection process would be good for flexibility, control, and offline work.</p>\n<h3>Flexibility</h3>\n<p>GraphQL's filters and transforms are powerful, and Gatsby's APIs add more<br>\noptions for how data is fetched, cached, and transformed. However, complicated<br>\nor non-standard data transforms and sanitization are much easier outside of<br>\nGatsby's ecosystem. For instance, the API starts to feel clunky for one-off<br>\ntreatment of specific content nodes,</p>\n<h3>Control</h3>\n<p>I've had a good experience with Gatsby but I may decide to migrate my site to<br>\nanother platform or format someday. Keeping my data entirely separate from the<br>\nfrom the site's framework makes migrating my data as easy as copy/pasting this<br>\ndirectory. It's just a few JS files!</p>\n<h3>Offline</h3>\n<p>Gatsby stores requests made through its source plugins in the <code>.cache</code><br>\ndirectory by default. The <code>.cache</code> directory is deleted after:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gatsby clean</code> is called.</li>\n<li><code>package.json</code> changes, for example a dependency is updated or added.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-config.js</code> changes, for example a plugin is added or modified.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-node.js</code> changes, for example if a new Node API is invoked.</li>\n<li>…etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found I was frequently triggering <code>.cache</code> wipes during development. At best<br>\nthis meant I was pinging APIs and atom feeds more than necessary. At worst, it<br>\nmade working offline with project data impossible.</p>\n<h2>Directory structure</h2>\n<p>Here's how the scraper is organized for now:</p>\n<pre><code>scrape-projects.js\n\tThe megafile to replace Gatsby's source plugins. This pulls project data\n\tfrom all online sources and saves them into `_generated/`.\n\n_generated/\n\tFiles generated by the `scrape-projects.js` above. DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES\n\tMANUALLY!

Read more about my reasoning below, or<br>\nskip to the <a href=\"#structure\">directory structure</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>Gatsby's source and transformer plugins are powerful, and I used them in the<br>\ninitial development of this site. I eventually decided that separating my<br>\ncollection process would be good for flexibility, control, and offline work.</p>\n<h3>Flexibility</h3>\n<p>GraphQL's filters and transforms are powerful, and Gatsby's APIs add more<br>\noptions for how data is fetched, cached, and transformed. However, complicated<br>\nor non-standard data transforms and sanitization are much easier outside of<br>\nGatsby's ecosystem. For instance, the API starts to feel clunky for one-off<br>\ntreatment of specific content nodes,</p>\n<h3>Control</h3>\n<p>I've had a good experience with Gatsby but I may decide to migrate my site to<br>\nanother platform or format someday. Keeping my data entirely separate from the<br>\nfrom the site's framework makes migrating my data as easy as copy/pasting this<br>\ndirectory. It's just a few JS files!</p>\n<h3>Offline</h3>\n<p>Gatsby stores requests made through its source plugins in the <code>.cache</code><br>\ndirectory by default. The <code>.cache</code> directory is deleted after:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gatsby clean</code> is called.</li>\n<li><code>package.json</code> changes, for example a dependency is updated or added.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-config.js</code> changes, for example a plugin is added or modified.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-node.js</code> changes, for example if a new Node API is invoked.</li>\n<li>…etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found I was frequently triggering <code>.cache</code> wipes during development. At best<br>\nthis meant I was pinging APIs and atom feeds more than necessary. At worst, it<br>\nmade working offline with project data impossible.</p>\n<h2>Directory structure</h2>\n<p>Here's how the scraper is organized for now:</p>\n<pre><code>scrape-projects.js\n\tThe megafile to replace Gatsby's source plugins. This pulls project data\n\tfrom all online sources and saves them into `_generated/`.\n\n_generated/\n\tFiles generated by the `scrape-projects.js` above. DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES\n\tMANUALLY!

It worked for me!</p>\n<p>But I planned to eventually make an easier way to browse existing<br>\nexperiments. It would benefit me a bit, and casual viewers a lot.</p>\n<p>I haven't updated this repository in nearly two years, and I honestly<br>\nnever expect to again. I'm doing less browser-based creative coding<br>\nthese days, and trying to stretch my work in other directions.</p>\n<p>About an hour ago, I decided to create an index page or dropdown<br>\nto close this project out and keep it accessible in perpetuity. When I<br>\ncloned the repo and started looking at the build pipeline, I almost<br>\nnoped the whole idea. I built this with <code>create-react-app</code>, so even<br>\nadding new pages for each project <em>the recommended way</em> involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installing some sort of React-compliant router.</li>\n<li>Spending… hours? figuring out which version of which router<br>\nworks with the project's outdated dependencies, OR,</li>\n<li>Upgrading the entire project, likely involving major upgrades to<br>\nWebpack, Babel, etc.</li>\n<li>Installing something called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot\" rel=\"nofollow\">react-snapshot</a>,<br>\nwhich apparently builds static files for you? But there's still<br>\na <code>pushState</code> history API? The README listed some tutorials, so I<br>\nopened them.</li>\n<li>…once I'd reached this point, I realized I'd need another method if<br>\nI wanted to be done within the hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At that point, I could have searched the web for \"create-react-app<br>\nstatic routes 2017 easy\" and gone down that rabbit hole before giving<br>\nup. OR, I could have given up immediately. Or I could do what I did,<br>\nwhich was a good idea:</p>\n<p>I changed the root component 38 times by hand, typed \"npm run build\"<br>\ninto my terminal by hand, and dragged the built files BY HAND into<br>\nunique directories that I created BY HAND.</p>\n<p>Gasp!</p>\n<p>I spent another minute in my editor surrounding the output of <code>ls -d</code><br>\nwith anchor tags for a root index. (yes, by hand)</p>\n<p>The most time-intensive part of the process was writing this commit<br>\nmessage. I'm confident if I'd tried to automate the process or rebuilt<br>\nthe project \"the right way\", I'd be at this for a few more hours.</p>\n<p>The result is a little sketchy. Namely, I'm sure the total payload of<br>\neach page is a bit bigger, and caching takes a hit.

It worked for me!</p>\n<p>But I planned to eventually make an easier way to browse existing<br>\nexperiments. It would benefit me a bit, and casual viewers a lot.</p>\n<p>I haven't updated this repository in nearly two years, and I honestly<br>\nnever expect to again. I'm doing less browser-based creative coding<br>\nthese days, and trying to stretch my work in other directions.</p>\n<p>About an hour ago, I decided to create an index page or dropdown<br>\nto close this project out and keep it accessible in perpetuity. When I<br>\ncloned the repo and started looking at the build pipeline, I almost<br>\nnoped the whole idea. I built this with <code>create-react-app</code>, so even<br>\nadding new pages for each project <em>the recommended way</em> involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installing some sort of React-compliant router.</li>\n<li>Spending… hours? figuring out which version of which router<br>\nworks with the project's outdated dependencies, OR,</li>\n<li>Upgrading the entire project, likely involving major upgrades to<br>\nWebpack, Babel, etc.</li>\n<li>Installing something called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot\" rel=\"nofollow\">react-snapshot</a>,<br>\nwhich apparently builds static files for you? But there's still<br>\na <code>pushState</code> history API? The README listed some tutorials, so I<br>\nopened them.</li>\n<li>…once I'd reached this point, I realized I'd need another method if<br>\nI wanted to be done within the hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At that point, I could have searched the web for \"create-react-app<br>\nstatic routes 2017 easy\" and gone down that rabbit hole before giving<br>\nup. OR, I could have given up immediately. Or I could do what I did,<br>\nwhich was a good idea:</p>\n<p>I changed the root component 38 times by hand, typed \"npm run build\"<br>\ninto my terminal by hand, and dragged the built files BY HAND into<br>\nunique directories that I created BY HAND.</p>\n<p>Gasp!</p>\n<p>I spent another minute in my editor surrounding the output of <code>ls -d</code><br>\nwith anchor tags for a root index. (yes, by hand)</p>\n<p>The most time-intensive part of the process was writing this commit<br>\nmessage. I'm confident if I'd tried to automate the process or rebuilt<br>\nthe project \"the right way\", I'd be at this for a few more hours.</p>\n<p>The result is a little sketchy. Namely, I'm sure the total payload of<br>\neach page is a bit bigger, and caching takes a hit. But I think an<br>\nextra kilobyte will be tolerated by the 3 people who ever visit this<br>\ncorner of my website.</p>\n<p>And wow it was so easy.
