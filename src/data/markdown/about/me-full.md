## About me

`markdown:about/me-intro.md`

Throughout my career, I have focused on accessibility, mentorship, and community. I am a proud graduate of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=4bdcd56dfdb6c80c7832262c0bb8007b) and the [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/). I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, with a focus on human-computer interaction.

I have the dubious honor of being recognized as one of Canada's 30 Under 30 developers.
