## About this website

This website aggregates content that Iâ€™ve littered across the Internet. I wrote a [small utility to scrape the web](http://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/rileyjshaw-new/2488bcd5e5610f692773e7815fabdb247ece55f5) which runs daily. I structured my website this way to regain ownership of the collection and presentaton of my data.

If you like the idea of website-as-API, [I have some feeds that you can subscribe to](/subscribe).
