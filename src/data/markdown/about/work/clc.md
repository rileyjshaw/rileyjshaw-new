### Canada Learning Code

I am a volunteer mentor and instructor with [Canada Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/). I mostly work within these branches:

-   [Girls Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/experiences/?program=girls_learning_code)
-   [Ladies Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/experiences/?program=ladies_learning_code)
-   [Teachers Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/experiences/?program=teachers_learning_code)

Curriculum content ranges from teaching girls how to make video games to helping teachers learn more about digital privacy.
