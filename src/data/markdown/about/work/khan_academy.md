### Khan Academy

I spent three years as a Software Engineer at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org). Here are some highlights:

-   I rewrote the video page and player, reducing load time by over 100%
-   I created and led KA's first optimization team
-   I [built this interface](https://youtu.be/RxKZOhS72Cw) as the sole developer on LearnStorm 2017 [ðŸŽ‰](https://youtu.be/gIvD4OYCbbA)
-   I led our formal mentorship program
-   Over 3 years, I deleted more lines of code than I added

For most of my time at Khan Academy I worked remotely from Toronto, Canada. I'm honored to have worked with such brilliant and passionate folks.
