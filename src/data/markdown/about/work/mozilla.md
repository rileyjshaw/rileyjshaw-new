### Mozilla <span class="job-title">Staff Software Engineer</span>

I worked at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) on the Open Innovation team, supporting [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org). Common Voice is a landmark consent-driven dataset for human speech of all types, spanning over 60 languages. For many, voice recognition and synthesis is the primary interface for their devices. Common Voice is an open, inclusive, and privacy-conscious standard for a technology that is rapidly becoming ubiquitous. Here are some highlights of my time there:

-   I joined the team as Mozillaâ€™s sole engineer, one month before a major partnership project was due. The project was estimated for three months but we somehow released on time.
-   I then helped oversee and implement a major infrastructure migration for one of the largest open source voice datasets.
-   I enabled recording on mobile browsers, opening the contribution process to many more people.
