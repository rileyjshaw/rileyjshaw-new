### Recurse Center

I attended [RC](https://recurse.com) in early 2014. While there, I worked on:

-   [A better way to transition colors](https://rileyjshaw.com/blog/hue-angle-transitions) (adopted by [Framer](https://www.framer.com/))
-   [A biological simulations and cellular automata library](https://rileyjshaw.com/terra)
-   [A bunch](http://ushld.rileyjshaw.com) [of goofy](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/own-this-website) [web](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/boxes) [apps](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/filesupply)
-   [A real-time collaborative coding environment](https://github.com/neerajwahi/pairjam)
-   [A tiny graph database engine written in C](https://github.com/adventure-db/adventure)
-   [A Ludum Dare entry that used phone gyroscopes as controllers](https://github.com/ben-eath/the-surf-ace)
-   [A personal website](https://v2.rileyjshaw.com/)
-   Learning a bit of Haskell (of course)
-   Making friends

My favorite projects were the spontaneous collaborations that happened each day, most of which aren't listed here. I had a wonderful time.

I am part of the interviewer team for Recurse Center. [Care to apply?](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=4bdcd56dfdb6c80c7832262c0bb8007b)
