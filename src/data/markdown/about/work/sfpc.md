### School for Poetic Computation

I attended the [School for Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.io) in early 2018, where I [kept a blog](https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/). My goal was to focus on:

-   Education and the reinforcement of class structures
-   Deletion, permanence, and consistency
-   Repurposing corporate tools
-   Making friends
-   [Making nothing](https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/172372422682/making-nothing)

[My final project](https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/182905537092/final-showcase-project-depression) was about depression, which was a surprise for me. Here’s a link to [my application for the program](https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171435065582/my-school-for-poetic-computation-application). I learned a lot about art and about myself. I’m grateful for the experience.
