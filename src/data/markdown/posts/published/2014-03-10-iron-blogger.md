A few days ago a fellow Hacker-Schooler proposed Iron Blogger to our batch. The rules are simple:

1. Get a blog
2. Write on said blog at least once a week
3. Failing completion of #2, be humiliated and ostracized. Also, forfeit $5.

I don’t think that we’ve decided on where the money is going yet; I’m hoping for giant Iron Blogger belt buckles.

## Of course I’ll do that!

At the start of the batch I vowed to avoid any projects focusing on front-end design work, including a personal site.

Oops.

I also vowed to try my hand at blogging; breaking one vow to fulfill the other can’t be that bad, right? I made an addendum, stating that I could spend exactly **two** days making a site… and here we are!

## It had to happen

Getting rid of my old site was increasingly pressing, and I’m relieved to have finally made the move. I threw my last one together during exam season a few summers ago to send out to employers, then promptly lost access to the server that it was on. I’ve done a lot since then but The Site Remained The Same, showcasing a bunch of work that I’d outgrown. Going through Google Analytics and seeing people flicking through my old portfolio made me really uncomfortable.

Though there’s much more to be done, I’m happy with the way this new site is turning out. The build process was pretty cool; I made some things that could be handy for other would-be-bloggers. I’ll definitely post about it soon, since, y’know, I have a blog now…
