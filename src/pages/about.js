				If we do not understand how complex technologies function, how
				systems of technologies interconnect, and how systems of
				systems interact, then we are powerless within them, and their
				potential is more easily captured by selfish elites and inhuman
				corporations… this understanding cannot be limited to the
				practicalities of how things work: it must be extended to how
				things came to be, and how they continue to function in the
				world in ways that are often invisible and interwoven. What is
				required is not understanding, but literacy.
