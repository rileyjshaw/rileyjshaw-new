						If we do not understand how complex technologies
						function, how systems of technologies interconnect, and
						how systems of systems interact, then we are powerless
						within them, and their potential is more easily
						captured by selfish elites and inhuman corporationsâ€¦
						this understanding cannot be limited to the
						practicalities of how things work: it must be extended
						to how things came to be, and how they continue to
						function in the world in ways that are often invisible
						and interwoven. What is required is not understanding,
						but literacy.
