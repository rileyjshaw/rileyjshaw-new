Where both operator and object are human beings, technical action is an exercise of power. Where, further, society is organized around technology, technological power is the principle form of power in the society. It is realized through designs which narrow the range of interests and concerns that can be represented by the normal functioning of the technology and the institutions which depend on it. This narrowing distorts the structure of experience and causes human suffering and damage to the natural environment.","author":null,"source":"Critical Theory of Technology: An Overview","cite":"https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/books/critbio.pdf","relatedLink":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171126039722/technology-is-a-two-sided-phenomenon-on-the-one"},{"id":"d4909cbd-1b14-5d3c-9f1b-44304b64b6fd","uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171126059207","content":"This partial institutional separation of the levels of instrumentalization encourages the belief that they are completely distinct.

Technology has other beneficial potentials that are suppressed under the capitalism and state socialism that could emerge along a different developmental path. In subjecting human beings to technical control at the expense of traditional modes of life while sharply restricting participation in design, technocracy perpetuates elite power structures inherited from the past in technically rational forms. In the process it mutilates not just human beings and nature,but technology as well. A different power structure would innovate a different technology with different consequences.","author":null,"source":"Critical Theory of Technology: An Overview","cite":"https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/books/critbio.pdf","relatedLink":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171126336622/the-technocratic-tendency-of-modern-societies"},{"id":"fd2b0116-9a8d-5e43-8f3d-c8e0b6a3c42b","uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171126377257","content":"The larger implication of this approach has to do with the ethical limits of the technical codes elaborated under the rule of operational autonomy. The very same process in which capitalists and technocrats were freed to make technical decisions without regard for the needs of workers and communities generated a wealth of new “values,” ethical demands forced to seek voice dis-cursively. Most fundamentally, democratization of technology is about finding new ways of privileging these excluded values and realizing them in the new technical arrangements.","author":null,"source":"Critical Theory of Technology: An Overview","cite":"https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/books/critbio.pdf","relatedLink":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171126377257/the-larger-implication-of-this-approach-has-to-do"},{"id":"bffe4e55-7d1d-5dcc-a574-99f262b6ee49","uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171127763052","content":"Characteristically, a technocratic notion of modernity inspires a positioning of the user that sharply restricts potential initiative, while a democratic conception enlarges initiative in more complex virtual worlds.","author":null,"source":"Critical Theory of Technology: An Overview","cite":"https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/books/critbio.pdf","relatedLink":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171127763052/characteristically-a-technocratic-notion-of"},{"id":"ad1c1c41-0e0c-5c7d-92eb-12e16176d6b8","uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171128489545","content":"the work of past ages accumulates, and is remade again","author":"Osamu Sato","source":null,"cite":"https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Osamu+Sato%22","relatedLink":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171128489545/the-work-of-past-ages-accumulates-and-is-remade"},{"id":"f6c593d8-b2a6-5214-bbd2-bfdce8d5289e","uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171149535302","content":"The increased deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward authoritarianism.
